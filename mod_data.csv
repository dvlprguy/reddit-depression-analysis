0,what is wrong with my dad and what should i do about him sorry for the long post i was not sure where to post this so i just put it under a bit of background info my parents have been divorced since i was for as long as i can remember my dads been threatening the things i like to keep me in line when i was or i had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if i did not play the piano these days he threatens to sell my phone and my computer which he knows i need for homework when i do not attend swim practice at a club i have been going to for years he is also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces which cost about because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice not to mention she is unemployed he is also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he is gotten mad he called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my moms house and he is called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood he often tries to guilttrip me when i piss him off usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while i waste my time on my computer there was a point back in and grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse but he is improved since then and it gave me hope that he would stop the threats and angry rants also he rarely goes through with his threats although that does not make them any less hurtful besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts he is a generally normal parent i can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody but i am afraid she cannot handle the financial burden of having me fulltime i am also a little suspicious of her because i remember her hitting me before my parents divorced even though she denies it however she is a much better parent than my dad right now so my questions are should i consider my dad abusive should i take action

1,i am years old and have lived with depressiondysthymia my whole life i am going on one year of marriage to the most wonderful man ever i have always wanted children until recently i am going through yet another depressive spell where i can barely function and come home after a highpowered job with headaches and complete mental exhaustion i barely have enough for me and even less for my husband how could i handle a baby it is pretty much inevitable i will have postpartum when i thought about adoption i realized that i would still be primary caretaker for a child and what if i cannot be there for the child i am so angry that this condition hinders so much in my life anyone else struggle with this
0,friendships i am heartbroken i have a gorgeous looking kind caring and funny old son who is struggling to make friendships in christchurch he also struggled to make friends at school anytime meet ups were are organised they pull out on him he told me today he has given up asking folk to meet up he was fun and sociable within school and college hours but no one ever seems to invite him anywhere he does not want or need pity but he would love some friends to hang out with
1,that eternal slumber tired not here to be saved nearly have a career a so friends amp family who care for me but it will never be enough to keep me around been depressed since age my first suicide attempt was at and convinced my life will end by my own hand eventually lurked here but never posted i had to reach out somehow and was not going to call or text the goddamn crisis line the world sees me as happy and outgoing even when honest about my depression bc i show it to anyone lonely tired not sure how much i have left to give i try i do i wake up amp try to be positive make the most of each day but just going through the motions that song has been stronger these past few weeks tonite ended with me locked in the bathroom sitting on the floor in a fat disgusting pathetic crying heap razor blade in hand one of my cats scratching at the door amp me trying to hush her so as not to wake my so through the tears i pathetically sliced away at my inner leg a few times been a decade since cut no relief no point to any of this no ultimate conclusion not looking for advice or friendship i just needed someone out there to know how desperately i long for that final sleep
1,i wish people that have never experienced depression could still understand there are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that is what they do it is so fucking shit i should be grateful i have people that care about me i know but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit i really feel because they do not see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak it is not even their fault it is just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reasons beyond your control why is it that any physical illness gets so much sympathy and empathy from everyone but the second it is a mental issue there is no excuse for it
1,am i the only one when in social situations even around friends i just want to go home i feel like a horrible circle to get stuck in because every single time home depressed and want to be out but when with friends i just want to go back home
0,i had to have someone explain to me what this thing is an online diary cool i can do this where should i start
1,ok so today i had another freak out i woke up feeling good it was supposed to be my first therapy session which i and my boyfriend were happy about and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch check my test marks and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study these plans changed when i walked into the therapy office they said no appointment was scheduled all of a sudden i felt really rejected not worthy of an appointment like they gave it to someone else anxious sick to my stomach a little dizzy i have been waiting since february for this appointment i could not deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today i started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment so it is tomorrow at what bastards anyway so because i got all weird i did not want to be around people i called my boyfriend could not get a hold of him i cancelled did not check my marks did not go to the library or lunch or see my boyfriend i left i told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety so now he wants a break and i have been in my room since i got home since about feeling really low and weird and lightheaded i have been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair it is a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have do not ask i am mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most is this cold or what at the same time i understand he wants his brain clear for exam studying whatever i guess it is hard being with a depressed neurotic girl no one wants to be with a depressed girl let us not kid ourselves here
0,how to drift away from a best friend you do not like anymore i have a friend and i am trying to put distance between us they are generally a nice person but do some mean things occasionally but they are quite boring okay very boring i do not even know how i have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past years i need a best friend with whom i can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about school let us call them b b has clung to me for the past years so they do not have any other friends i have loads of other friends but they all assume that i am best friends with b so they do not make an effort to include me in their friendship group i have told quite a few of them and they are giving me some advice on what to do but i want to see what all of you say for the past few weeks i have been making it quite clear that i do not really want to talk to b i give them short answers as replies do not make eye contact or initiate conversations and i have generally been ignoring them i know it sounds mean but i have had enough i cannot deal with clingy people however b is either extremely oblivious or they are just being really stubborn also even though i am ignoring b i sit next to them in lots of lessons and i also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me so infuriating i do not want to change rooms because then i will not be with my friends another thing is that if i ignore b i actually look like a loner i ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time i mean everyone in my school already thinks i am sort of weird child that studies all of the time because i always seem to be studying at school which is actually because i do not do anything at home i also have to eat by myself at lunch and having social anxiety definitely does not help with that i know i should not care about that but it is hard not to i went off on a tangent there did not i so basically what i am trying to ask you is that should i completely completely ignore b e g do not talk to them at all or is that too mean please do not suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them because i do not want to do that i want to make exciting friendships that i will remember and not be stuck with a boring person also i am i do not know if that will help but meh b has turned into one of those people that you just want to punch in the face for no reason do you sort of get what i mean anyway thanks for listening to this ranty thing it took ages to write
1,anyone else just come to accept that never going to get better that this is just how meant to be for you so no use getting upset about it anymore just have to take it as it comes

1,nightmares and dreams hi i do not know about you but when i was a kid i used to have this weird nightmares not the teeth fell out usual nightmares like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive like sleep paralysis but dreaming or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me anyway as i grew older and my depression grew with me i stopped having nightmares i can barely recall when the last one was instead i have pretty vivid dreams not lucid ones and in most of them i am at some kind of weird scenery where i feel like i have always been there and weird shit happens that i can remember and it is like a full story a lot of different things happen in the same dream the problem is in most of them i meet someone normally a girl with which i start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship like my biggest desire these dreams as good as they sound are worst than the nightmares because when i wake up it takes some time to realize that i did not live that shit that i am still in bed and i am still alone

0,hi friends me and another friend are looking for more friends to add to our small circle requirements include a sense of humor no filter and tolerance to offensive topics and subjects and lastly the ability to debate and push your point stubbornly even if wrong
1,no one has a monopoly on suffering we keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering but both do not happen without something happening to us it is at these times that we are changing in some way suffering can give us greater empathy and understanding it can strip away all the other stuff so many say they will always be depressed that may or may not be the case but everyone has right to live their lives suffering included however there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term cyclical depression you can learn to live with depression it may profoundly change your life take much away from you but you can learn to live with it long term depression is not static like any illness it changes but we know depression is different because it so cruelly takes away our hope of a brighter future but be stubborn and it will change again to state in a forum like this that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulders of other people it hands the possibility of that personal choice on to others which is unfair genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations there are times when i feel like ending my life and the thoughts nudge at me constantly but i recognize them now for what they are the depression talking with each episode i have learnt new ways to try and tag these thoughts ultimately the illness is happening to me the thoughts happen to me but i would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence it is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their lives as much as the depression is darkening my own please think before you make threats of suicide in the chat room or forums there is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair by all means we can talk about it but saying i am going to do it is simply selfish and smacks of attention seeking such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferers of depression in the eyes of so many it is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art please stop attention seeking and stop using depression as a convenient coat hanger for emotional immaturity and lack of personal responsibility for so many people this really is a matter of life and death
1,i really do not know what to do i have suffered with depression for the past years it comes and goes with treatment i thought i was over stuff but over the last little while it has got really bad again i feel so low so low and i cannot pick myself up i am drifting away from everyone they all enjoy going to the pub etc and i hate being with loads of people and i do not drink so i do not go out they have given up on me now i hate my job that brings me down so much i work for the ambulance service taking calls and i cannot deal with the pain and suffering of everyone anymore a year old girl died the other day whilst i was on the phone and it is just not fair i just cannot deal with stuff anymore i feel alone i am dull and boring in debt and i just cannot see the point anymore the only thing keeping me afloat and i really feel like i am hanging on by the skin of my teeth is my boyfriend he is the only thing i live for and he is bound to dump me it is like a vicious circle i am incredibly insecure and he will get fed of it and dump me if he dumps me that will be it there will be nothing i think about it all the time i want time off so i can just be on my own but i am screwing up my chance of finding another job so i can get away from this one i do not know what to do i am seriously thinking about ending it all and i do not know how to pick myself up
0,how do you tell your kids to handle weird adults when i was my best friends mom started accusing me of smoking i had been best friends with her daughter since we were in grade and i was over their house all the time but for some reason when i was she started asking and she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about more years i had always been a straight a kid top of my class and a good kid i had tried one cigarette when i was had hated it and never tried another i was not around anyone who smoked no friends no peers no family members immediate or extended smoked so there is no chance i smelled like smoke but friends mom persisted and told me that she thought that i smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway because obviously that could not have been from anyone else right now in hindsight her behavior was absolutely bizarre as a teen i accepted it as she is an adult and while i questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she would say something it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved i am hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens while nothing truly bad happened in my case the lady was off her rocker and i am lucky nothing else happened how did people with older kids do that like i know my parents gave me the if people are making you uncomfortable talk to us speech but this never made me upset i just got angry and baffled at first but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her in hindsight this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated

0,how should i deal with angry best friend hi guys so basically in the past year ever since i started dating a boy he was my best friend for the most part in high school my current best friend a girl in my friendship group also from highshcool and i have gotten into many fights these fights are mainly about her arguing that she is no longer my number one priority and that she is just second priority to my boyfriend i do not think this is true and they are both important to me but in very different ways he in a romantic way and she in a friendship way she recently came back from overseas and i organised to meet up with her and we did i never heard from her initiating a meet up for the next few weeks or so but i finally did initiate a catch up with her after hearing nothing from her for weeks however this plan fell through because i ended up having a work shift yesterday my best friend had invited me to catch up with her before she went to work she had work at i messaged her asking if we could hang out until she asked me why i stay until with her till she had to go to work and i explained bevause i had invited my boyfriend over for lunch and movies at my house this catch up with my boyfriend was meant to be another day but got postponed to the same day as my catchup with my best friend due to him getting sick she got very angry and told me she now does not want to see me at all and cancelled the catchup because she said she felt second priority she said she have to change her plans for my boyfriend who i see so much more compared to her i would love to see her more but she never plans anything with me or when i do ask her when free she always has family plans she also brought up the previous weeks events of me cancelling our plans due to me having work and got angry with me for never trying to find another day to make up for these cancelled plans i tried explaining to her how important she is to me and how i see her as second priority or never meant to make her feel like second priority but she is giving me silent treatment or being passive aggressive i am tired of having to prove to her that she is important to me and i am tired of this drama my boyfriend is so wonderful and he is always there for me and replies to me instantly and we share many things on a personal level emotionally physically etc so to me it seems natural that i will try and adjust my plans to try and accommodate him as he does so much for me that nobody else does not even my best friend so i understand why she expects to be higher in priority than my bf and happy with being the same priority as him i am tired and confused know how to respond to her passive and blunt messages to me after i tried apologising and explaining please help

1,i have a gripe about pharmaceutical and insurance companies you can take up to mg day of wellbutrin xl the manufacturer makes mg and mg pills but not a mg pill ok so just take of the right well if the doctor prescribes it that way at least one insurance company will not pay for it the doctor has to prescribe it as one mg pill plus one mg pill thereby making the patient have to pay co payments for what should be one prescription why does not the manufacturer make a mg pill and how can the insurance companies get away with forcing doctors to prescribe in what is really a stupid manner i know it all comes down to money but of course we patients get the short end of the stick as usual when it comes to the money issue

0,communicating is hard i am turning this year and i want to move out of my familys house in september mostly for my studies but also because i simply want to move out i already tried last year but they found a housing for young girls managed by nuns so i lived here for a while but i felt uneasy the whole time i am heavily depressed and i had to drop out of school this year my parents told me to come back home so that i could recover which i did but they do not approve of me going anywhere else to do so for example i feel really good in my boyfriends family he does not live with them anymore but i am still very close to them and wish to spend more time there but my parents do not like the idea of not being able to give me the kind of comfort i need and find over there so they would rather have me stay home i have spent as little time as possible in my parents house recently using every opportunity to get away and it is understandable they do not like it but i have always been a solitary kid and now with my depression it became worse i do not connect with my parents or any of my siblings and spending time with them feels like a chore communicating within the family is quite rough and whenever i do try to explain how i feel it becomes overwhelmingly clear that i am in the wrong it feels like whatever i say about feeling bad within the family is deflected by stating my parents and siblings good intents i am sure they do mean well but i now doubt even my own reasons for wanting anything but staying with them i cannot identify the reason why i do not feel easy with them because they are all trying their best to help me through those tough times i feel like an ungrateful brat i am not really confrontational either i usually obey and agree to avoid stirring conflict but this is getting tiring if any of you has been in a similar situation how can you open the dialogue how can i tell my parents i do not feel good spending much time with them in my family direct family should come before everything i also do not know how to talk about moving out and have a studio instead of being placed in a student housing especially since my big sister still lives at home despite having a job it is not a matter of money either i come from a middle class family and the housing my parent chose for me this year is much more expensive than a studio any advice would be welcomed
1,i do not know what to do with myself anymore last year i met a wonderful friend online we began dating in february of and have been inseparable ever since however we both have mental illnesses for me i have ptsd and depression and for him adhd and depression he is being treated for both i am untreated because of my family and our financial situation i am afraid i am frustrating him i feel like i am dragging him down he is tried to get me to take better care of myself but it is hard seeing as we are long distance and i always slip back into my bad habits i feel like i pissed him off tonight and i never understood why he got frustrated but now i think i do no matter what i did not really listen or heed his advice and i am afraid because of that he is going to decide that i am unmanageable and he will leave me i am terrified i am going to make him resent me i am at my wits end he is my best friend and i am very in love with him but i just do not know how to be better for him i am up at in the morning school tomorrow crying because i am afraid of losing the one person who has not given up yet i do not know what to do

1,dear reddit happiness is not a choice for everyone i am sorry but i need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me dear people that think happiness is a choice it is not me or my fellow sufferers do not choose to be miserable in fact if it really was that simple i am sure of us would choose to be happy without even having to think i feel sad because i have mental illness if you do not know that means my brain is not normal my brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy even when i should i am so sick of reading replies to mine and other peoples post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can because suicide i swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves i really cannot believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable you would not choose to be miserable if you had the choice and so would we but we do not get that choice then we have comments like just put a life together that will not make you depressed i think these piss me off the most if it was really that simple you think i would of done that by now also a lot of people do not mention how hard changing your life can be if you do not have money or resources tldr stop oversimplifying a serious illness

0,oy vey its about three in the a m and i just got back from a midnight showing of farenheit urllink wow there were reports of people actually being so appalled at this film to go as far as slashing the screen in anger and it is easy to see why to put it bluntly i love michael moore in short it is about the bush adminidstration and such follies and gags mr moore goes into the very bowels of the bush admniistrationtoo big of a word for this late at night and brings up all the dirty secrets that they have been hiding in the past four years it goes from the election to the patriot act all the way through the war in iraq not only that but he got to poke fun at bush the entire time its good wholesome family fun actually i should not say that there are in fact a lot of very graphic scenes that were incredibly hard to watch a lot of things that made me incredibly angry that this could ever happen even though some of these things were very difficult for me to watch it is necessary to know about such things so that we can know what is going on in our nation there are also urllink a few points that i wanted to be put in that were not this movie also made me incredibly frustrated that i still being a minor cannot vote on this topic the movie is two hours and three minutes long is rated r and should be angering republicans in a theatre near you

1,girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work my girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients she has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is stressed during the days and does not want to go to work most days since we do not live together we see eachother about three times per week although less during summer since work prohibits that to an extent she has never during our two year long relationship showed any signs of self harm nor depression however today i saw her for the first time this week and i noticed bruises on her fore arm she unwillingly explained that she had tried to break her arm in order to not have to go to work anymore for the rest of the summer she said that she had had a panic attack and in desperation smashed her arm into a metal pole in order to break her arm she promised to let me know if she felt that way again but i am not sure if she is going to she also made me promise to not tell anyone about it how can i help prevent her from harming herself another time what other things are there that i should be aware of concerning her well being i hope this is the proper sub for this and i would be very thankful for your advice

1,feeling good is an excellent book i have reread a few times when i have felt the need if you are looking at something for anxiety and panic i suggest mastering anxiety and panic revision iii by david barlow i suffered from anxiety panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time i was until last year that is years nothing had ever helped until i found a therapist that uses that program a different way of looking at things and i have to say that i worked miracles for me i am driving flying going to concerts sporting events things i have not done for over years i never thought i could get better and only went because my boyfriend of years was honest with me and told me that he did not know if he could spend the rest of his life going every place alone that was a wake up call for me and to my surprise i found that i could do it i still have my depression and i am endlessly working on being medicated correctly for that all of you know how that is you can buy just the workbook oxford university press well worth the money

0,marriage marriage is what brings us together today the princess bride women can be frustrating my girlfriend and i just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married she then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family since she leff i keep thinking that she will say she does not love me and does not want to marry me i have told her i love her and that i want to marry her but have not yet proposed she is the type that likes to know all about what is going to happen before it happens so she asked me all about the future and what i think about when we should get married and what will happen after that i told her i want to marry her in december she objects because she is a school teacher like meand that is a busy time of year i am okay with doing it another time like june but i love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now anyway i am ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away but i am probably being stupid and untrusting she cares very much for me and i know that for sure so i should just be content with that
0,so here i am one of those people who likes to hide behind who they really are someone who is afraid to express their honest opinions because they do not want to hurt anyone but this is fun because there is not a single person well okay except maybe my sister who know that this is really me let the fun begin to give you a better idea of who i am and what i like i figured that i would start out with some websites that i check frequently i get my basic news headlines here i also really like the sight because it has a lot of entertainment news and fun chats so when i am really bored at work i can bug people besides my coworkers which is a word that i have never really liked because every time i look at it i only see the word cow granted some of my coworkers have been along the cow lines but still that is just mean i am applying to law school for the fall mostly because i do not know what else to do and i am actually entertained by the thought of spending more years in school so i check out and for some up to date information okay so i am actually really excited about going to law school i know that millions of people are doing it so i thought that i would be one of those millions no just kidding i know that the job market will be tough when i get out but it is tough right now and i cannot stand my job why not get more edumacation it is almost funny i have not told my friends that i am going to law school i have good reason but that is definitely something for another entry i love to travel and like to check out for info about deals and new travel news i also check out for celebrity news yes i am one of those people but i have to live vicariously through someone so why not someone beautiful thin rich and famous okay enough for today i am sure that this is not interesting to most people but it is a lot of fun for me to write and i am sure that it will allow me some creative genuis have fun

1,has anyone been depression free for years i get better then i get much worse it is a cycle that will not stop i am wondering if there any older redditors that had severe depression as a young adult and are now completely free from it depression is almost certainly going to kill me whether it is the harmful way i cope to stay alive day to day or more directly if i by some miracle can get my hands on a gun is there anyone that has been cured and not worries about depression creeping back how did you do it
0,well i have been working on this damn thing for the last four months straight no days off not even weekends and the end is rapidly approaching friday the i get to defend this damn thing though my advisor keeps reassuring me i have nothing to worry about i cannot help but shake the feeling that something bad might happen nothing would suck more than spending years busting your ass in a lab and then not get your masters or more years and phd but that is not the case here maybe its just stress it may be the fact that i still have not found a job yet whatever it is i can not wait to get this over with on friday spend the evening with friends and then start planning for the rest of my life
0,hi there my name as you can see is brock i have been looking everywhere for a place for me to express myself thank you i am starting this school year as a junior just turned sixteen not looking for a girlfriend because i have found one she does not know it yet though well i guess i will create a profile now if you want to know more about me head there ps this is what part of the alphabet would look like if q and r were eliminated
0,how does it feel to have an abnormal next of kin i have a brother who people call retarded but actually he is not just family the one voluntarily has patience with him understand that when i was a kid i only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things we were watching tv and the editors were discussing some news instead of listening and talking about related topics as normal people do he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information if it is your familys case maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something but mine did nothing when i argued with him over such false information my parents even stopped me and said why do you have to argue with your poor brother i thought they would never tell him what is wrong and what is right at age of once he told me to pack things up because we would go for a trip with my moms friends i had no doubt and did exactly what he had said of course one day later i found out he lied at that moment he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed that is the moment i realized he is such an attention seeker he is selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself since then my parents never listen to me as i say he is not a fool he is slippery even and others saying i was blessed because all the bad luck on his place so i could live study and be the only child that parents could be proud of he is been living an easy life because people are working their asses off out there but he just needs to call mom and things will be done and none would want to resent him making mistakes because he is retarded just leave him they say i envy him should i be stupid in order to be noticed by my parents
0,not her storage building at the beginning of the year my friend move out her choice and my boyfriend moved she left some stuff behind and i would tell her to come get it all the time a small apartment and there really any room for me to stores her stuff here she would just say be by well a few months ago we cleaning the apartment making room for a baby and told him to take her stuff to storage well he must have thrown her carpet cleaner away because she asked for it and we find it now she is mad and saying i did her dirty i feel horrible but at the same time i told her multiple times to come get her stuff and she never would
1,i am a year old woman who is single and has no one special in my life i am becoming my disgusted with my life and where i am i really want to make my year yes i have said that every year since i turned i am at the lowest point that i did not want to reach i am afraid to sink any lower i am currently on effexor and linispril effexor is started to have a negative effect on my heath but i am so afraid of returning night terrors that i am afraid to allow my doctor to change it i am seeing a counselor but he is not working on my cognitive behavior i need someone to tell me positive things and to help me believe that i am not bad he just seems to repeat what i say i had someone before who focused on my thought patterns and it helped greatly
1,i wish i could have done things differently i graduated high school in june of currently i am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although i do not know how long i can keep it up back in high school i did not try as hard as i could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university freshmen year of high school i saw my lowest gpa ever i had gotten a gpa in the semester of that year hell i was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that i could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but i ended up getting caught if the university applications saw that i got a d in an art class they would have thought i was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university it was because of my second semester of freshmen year that i thought my chances of a four year were impossible i also never bothered to do the actsat because i thought that with my low gpa it would not have mattered anyway the following years in hs i have managed to improve a bit but not all that much after high school ended i spent a year and a half not really knowing what i was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing while also changing my major at least twice if i play my cards right i will be able to graduate by he end of may in and hopefully transfer to a university but recently i cannot help but think of how my life would have been if i had just went straight to a university after high school i do not have any friends right now and i feel that if i had gone to university out of high school i would have had friends at this point right after high school i did not really have any second thoughts and what i was doing i was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now i cannot help but feel that i have made a huge mistake if only i had done better in freshmen year i probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life i am only and i already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how i acted in my high school life if i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better i feel like i have massively screwed myself most of the time now i think about what i could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now i honestly hate everything about myself and wish that i could just go back and make things right in high school
1,alright this is a bit weird to explain but i am having a lot of trouble making this decision so i am going to try and write it down if anyone has any suggestions or advice to offer i would appreciate it a while back my brother and i let a stray cat in and fed it and we got really attached to it it is probably the most needy animal i have ever met and will sit with people all day loves it when you pet it and i really like the cat i was not thinking at the time but later i realized i needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex so i could keep the cat so my mother called up our landlords office and they said that we could not have the cat it seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals but for some reason we are not i do not think there is anything i can do about this and it makes me really sad we did not want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away letting it inside only at night and living in my brothers van in the day while we were looking to see if there was somewhere else we could move to the problem is i think i would only barely have enough money to move and i think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing not to mention that i keep my spare money around in the case of emergencies and if something bad were to happen i would not be able to deal with it financially so the only option i know of that is left is the animal shelter and i really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage i know that it is getting old and that people take younger cats from animal shelters much more often than older ones i want my cat to have a good place to live and do not want it to spend its final years in a cage without loving owners i am having so much trouble making this decision i love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy but i am endangering my family the longer i try to hide it my mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and i just keep procrastinating so i posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out are there any options i am leaving out do i either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter they both seem like such terrible options
0,after the work i am doing everyday i still find the chance to sitback and relax to a hot and not that comfortable room but slow music in the background in that hot and not comfortable room i realize lots of things like being alone in a valentines day in my years yup i always say i hate valentines day it is just for the couples who love each other ok it s a big lie the night i realized it we should celebrate the valentines day that we really love and care for like our families and true friends the next time that valentines day will come i will invite my whole barkada to have fun every entry i publish here would be my feelings and realizations in my hot and not that comfortable room i hope it can help you to realize things too
1,i am female and i live in the uk my background with depression is that i started suffering from it significantly when i was and have been on various antidepressants since i have recently come off effexor venlafaxine after about years of being on it at mostly the mg dose and this has been the only antidepressant that is properly helped me two months ago i decided to come off it as id been wanting to at least lower the dose i was taking for some time also my doctors surgery are now funnier about prescribing it to new patients because of the reports of heart murmurs among some patients i have been taking citalopram at either mg or mg but i do not really like these medications and after this month is up i am hoping to come off them either to go on something else or to stop taking antidepressants altogether those are my options but the truth is and my doctor is wondering as well what medications would i go on next i have felt pretty rotten lately and the citalopram has done little for me except negative stuff it makes me want to just take the venlafaxine again any thoughts comments or suggestions would be most welcome

1,i have so much pent up anger that i carry around with me all the time it seems as though it is about years old and it is now catching up to me and i am telling people off left and right i will honestly admit i talk a lot of shit and in the end people somehow walk all over me well not any more and not this time i always have a string of bad luck and tonight was no different when i was at brooks picking up some medications and the cashier slammed my change down and threw my slip at me i told her off then formally complained about her and you know something it felt damn good defending myself maybe it will boost some confidence in me because i have none
0,omg it is so hot and humid today was this close to being absolutely horrible but there was one saving grace and i will save that for the end of this post so today i realized the full extent of the work i have to do and should be doing now but its too fucking hot to stay focused and have not done all of my classes where boring as hell history was the usual blend of note taking and sitting around with nothing to do but today it was like a sauna this is not good i skipped chem to go have lunch with tegan which was really fun this would be the saving grace i mentioned after finally saying bye to her sigh i booked it back to elmira to make it to class only about min late for physics again it was like a sauna in that class even with the windows open and we watched a movie and worked on the project i left at home in my rush to meet tegan on time so effectively did nothing english was the same except the whole class did not do any work even mr miessner did not seem like he wanted to do work so he just let us talk all class that class was productive gossip wise because i found out some interesting things about chadders ex which i found quite funny verdict day as a whole sucked serious ass but there where a few good times thanks tegan

1,i have been having suicidal thoughts more than ever i feel like i fail at everything i do not have any motivation to clean or really do anything i feel like i am no good at anything and have gotten really lazy i am not the best wife and i have made many mistakes if i asked my husband to do something and he did not i would complain to try and get help if he is not doing anything i would not either now that he is moved out i feel like i do not really have any reason to live i used to smoke weed but had to stop a little under a month ago because i got arrested on my anniversary and am facing felony charges on something that is legal i have had to hire a lawyer and everything to try to keep my record clean i have had suicidal thoughts since i was in high school and kind of turned smoking a bowl into my medicine so i would always refuse depression meds i have heard mixed things about them and i am scared on how they would take effect on me but since the arrest i have been getting progressively worse and worse my husband was the one who initially got me to quit hurting myself and the thoughts keep haunting me more than ever one of the biggest reasons i have not been able to bring myself to doing it again is i care for others more than myself i could not hurt my friends and family like that but i am mentally going insane

0,close friend becoming distant so f had a friend m that known for over two years and we typically text or snap daily there are times where we are texting or snapping straight for a couple of hours or we get busy with other stuff so we reply when we have a chance two weeks ago we had been hanging out at his place and everything to me seemed normal then out of the blue this week i feel as though become extremely distant he stopped basically replying to me at all been a couple of days in a row that he only responds a couple of times in the morning and then is gone during the entire day since known him he has never been this way i am sure some might say he is in a relationship but he is currently single plus when he was in a relationship he did not act this way so last week i had sent him something early in the day and he reply until the following day i think much of it because the next couple of days we were chatting like nothing and i was sure he was completely busy keep in mind this was a couple days before he basically went blank on me it actually got me thinking of what i had said that first day and think why be so mad possibly to respond the day that it had all started i had told him i had applied to a place and had gotten a interview the following day i told him this even though told me been applying to different places and gotten a single interview when i told him i think that it would affect him that much since told me never apply to the place going to start working at like he straight up told me rather die than work at that place however he is not the type to be petty or take things like that extremely hard and to heart not sure how i should think about all of this i have anxiety which is why stressing but telling myself he may be going through something and i want to just push him gotten extremely close enough to the point where discussed things that are vulnerable things he is dealt with major stuff and so have i so i also find it weird that he talk to me about any of it if it was something personal should i continue waiting basically a day for a response or let it ride out and see if he gets back to himself and talks do you think trying to ghost me or should i ask him happening and if i do what should i say so that not exactly targeting him he has depression and we have discussed serious matters so i do not want to make him feel bad feel free to ask any questions thanks

0,when exactly do we go from being kids to being just people i am not sure i do know that it is not about turning a certain age or graduating from school it happens when you are not paying attention we go from playing with our friends to playing with our friends feelings without our knowledge or onsent childhood slips away in the night and our innocence escapes us and we wake up one morning to find who we are it makes no sense to me this all seems so confusing our parents tell us that we are not doing what we are supposed to be doing and that we are going to ruin our lives if we do this or that when in fact they did it themselves and they turned out just fine there is a ton of people out there that do drugs i know what they can do to you i mean i work with people at the bakers treat who are trying to get over what they have done to themselves it not news to me that you can get addicted and that its bad for you and what not i no this seems weird for me to be talking about but i have a point as most people know i live under a rock i do not go out all that often and when i do my mom has to know everyone that is going and has to make sure that all the parents know exactly what we are doing it is craziness tomorrow i turn friday i get my permit a year from friday i will have my license and will be able to go out whenever i want to or atleast i should be able to do that but knowing my mom i will not be able to i do not see y i cannot go out and just do what i want to do without being questioned i have never been to a concert because my mom thinks i am going to get raped i am not allowed to go to parks with my boyfriend because she thinks i am going to have sex in public yea like that is going to happen i actually do have morals lots of them even though i have borken like half of them but that does not matter my mom does not trust me or my friends she is in for a rude awakening my senior year and probably this year when my friends all get their licenses if my mom thinking i am going to go out and get high and drunk she is wrong i might do that once or twice but that is it haha but i do not no i probably would not even do it i just want to be trusted for once
1,insurance for therapy i have decided to look into getting a therapist to deal with issues of depression and anxiety i am still on my parents insurance plan which should cover most of the cost however i have heard it can be a bad idea to use insurance to pay for therapy as insurance companies can audit your sessions to see if you still require them to keep paying for it i am concerned about privacy and having trouble getting insured in the future with mental health issues on my record but paying out of pocket is not a great option either as i am currently a broke college student anyone have a similar situation

1,i want to be unloved so i can die without any attachments i like to drive people away i try to be rude to my family i get too anxious to keep up positive relationships with others i would rather be alone so when the time comes when i want to kill myself i will not be held down and i will not have anyone tying me to this world it is hard though it hurts me to push people away but it is for the best i wish i had no attachments i wish i had no family or friends to try to connect with i do not want them to be sad when i die my ultimate goal in life since i was was to die in peace without any attachments to the world or leaving enough money for my family they should not have to waste their care and time on someone like me

1,how are you i am not okay in a kind of adverse situation my thoughts are all over the place and i really know how to break this cycle basically what happened was that a few days ago i sent my best friend a message before school saying that i attend classes because i feeling too well that i felt like giving up and that in case i also have been at school the following day i had probably killed myself i joking sometimes i get these sort of most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions my thoughts and as a result of that it feels as though i lose my common sense my ability to think rationally my thought patterns become unpredictable but so far managed to not act on them or else i be writing this right now currently been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems so back to the story obviously my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because been staying at home that day but she also contacted my mom which i know until hours later and told her that i at school and made a concerning remark but i know exactly my mom started to call me like every minute and i started to panic because i thought a teacher had called her so i pick up any of her calls i spent the rest of the day with my friend but called my mom in the afternoon she asked my where i was and it sounded like she was crying and i told her that i was at my friends place but after that she declined the call that night i slept at my dads place my mom called him and told him that she care anymore about what i was doing and that kind of hit me it was the last thing i wanted to hear in that situation i just know what to do i really do feel miserable my friend is beating herself up because she thinks all her fault and i know i just feel bad for feeling bad if you know what i mean that message was a cry of help in a kind of way and i understand why my mom reacted the way she did it just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me been depressed for nearly five years now but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy been doing great for a good six months in but then somebody really important to me somebody that kept me going passed away in december and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse life has become so hard for me sleeping the days away because i bear the thoughts the guilt because too much of a coward to face reality trying i really am but no matter what i do this feeling this feeling that eradicates my will to live remains

1,i had skipped work today because this dream was too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it i have been able to hold onto my dreams a lot lately such as i can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream i left off now the dream is i am at some party the room is very lavish looking and everyone there i know feels like this party was somehow for me never has ever happened now the part that stands out is that i see my teacher who was my mentor she was everything to me when i was in high school i not only had this huge crush on her but she was the kind of actor i had always wanted to be except i was willing to die for my art still am she is sitting with her two kids they are probably the most gorgeous kids i have ever seen and she has not changed her husband is in the distance somewhere i never see him but i am aware of him i thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and i ask her how it is going with her life and if she is still teaching we talk about something else and the dream slowly fades away reality is i have not heard from this teacher since i graduated i heard she had a kid and she moved to vermont i miss her terribly somehow this dream seems to have more than just one meaning and since everyone else has dream threads i am going for one too
1,i am a yr old university student and i think i am getting depressed again one of the debates i am having with myself is whether or not this is really depression i was diagnosed with it about years or so ago although it was not my first bout of feeling low and was put on a high dosage of medications which i took things got better after a few months and so of course i stopped taking them cold turkey obviously not the best idea in the world aside from this being one of the worst things to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence my body went through heck and i had some pretty nasty side effects even worse than when i was actually taking the meds fortunately it did not reoccur and i have been feeling fine until the past couple of months i think i am feeling the warning signs again low energy crying circular thinking apathy towards everything skipping school sleeping all day anxiety i just feel like maybe this is not really depression maybe i am just a person who does not handle stress well jeeze when i read this it sounds so ridiculous part of me knows i am being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life why cannot i just be happy why do i have to be so moody why am i so weak it is stupid but i keep blaming myself i do not think i am bipolar since i have never experienced real highs but every couple of years or so my lows get really low last time was by far the worst and i would not have been able to get through it without medications and i do not want it to get to that point again but i guess i still feel a lot of shame about it it still feels like depression is being weak i know i know it is just like having diabetes and your body needs the chemicals to be normal but sigh i still blame myself last time i told my teachers and some friends and it is like they look at me as if i am contagious or insane i do not know if i can go through that again but i do not know if i can keep on pretending everything is alright either
1,in college years ago i was the victim of a gang rape i have read up quite a bit and identified with all the stages and normal reactions i went through the self blame and guilt and anger and depression and i came to realize it was not my fault i never reported it and after a year i decided the best thing would be to forget about it i pretended it did not happen and went on with my life i forced it out of my thoughts until it was no longer a struggle to do so eventually i almost did forget about it i never thought about it and when the subject was referenced in other contexts i never even thought about my particular experience it almost became some movie i saw or some girl i knew about i am married now with a four year old child and i have a really great life about six months ago i started having these rape fantasies i have been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out but he does oblige in rough sex and i started asking for it more often i have felt confused as to why i would want this with my husband and it is always with him i do not desire this with anyone else when i have this history it started me thinking about them even again then i started having nightmares about three weeks ago horrible realistic dreams where i actually wake up and i am still hallucinating that men are holding me down last night i punched my husband full in the chest because i thought he was attacking me when he was just trying to wake me from a nightmare this along with the complete lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life i am a big fan of the stop that approach to self help but i cannot seem to stop this i am beginning to dwell on it now also i try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he is having right now he is seeking sexual gratification every night i am beginning to dread bed time and after he is asleep i am up on the computer and drinking
1,anyone who can offer me advice on this it would be amazing my girlfriend is the greatest girl i have ever met i love her and want to marry her eventually heres my problem though she is still in high school and ever since i moved away to university i have been constantly constantly worrying about things i cannot control like when she drinks with her friends and whether or not i will still love her in a month whether or not she is going to suddenly ask herself what am i doing in a long distance relationship anyway these are all ridiculous things to worry about not only because she loves me to the ends of the earth but because i have zero control over them these worries are driving me insane and slowly ripping up our relationship does anyone have any advice to offer
1,god god moves towards those who need him the most and those who are emotionally broken really well where the fuck has he been for the past three years in my life i am tired of asking god to make me feel less depressed and never getting an answer i guess he does not give a shit about me but that has okay because now i do not give a shit about him either

1,no lodging for the sad being depressed sucks that is easy to grasp most people who am not clinically depressed understand this what they do not understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult and our ruggedly individualistic society does not give a single fuck about you you need help fuck you your wealth is not just something you have it is seen as a reflection of your worth as a person poor sad find it difficult to wake up find it difficult to complete things do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues fuck you you are just lazy the clear message capitalism sends me is that if i cannot work or i cannot work enough or i cannot work doing a high value job or if i need help to get better so that i can do those high value jobs i probably ought to just go die because i am clearly worth nothing
1,my depression is so strong that i even enjoy music music has been my favorite pass time for a year or so it really helps with my depression and anxiety sadly in such a deep depressive episode that i enjoy it it feels more like background music i just enjoy it also anxious i really know why i just started a new subreddit it makes me anxious thinking about it maybe i should remove it oh well thanks for reading

0,ok so this is my new blog hmmm i think this looks better over here do not you yes that is nicer ok then i would like you to go and visit my website which resides at urllink bunnis place it is not quite finished because my significant other has not finished providing me with his significant content for his part of the site but the rest is done or at least done enough that it might be considered enjoyable rather than annoying then again some people are annoyed by almost everything enjoyable one cannot make everyone happy i decided that a blog might be a nice addition as i need a place to whine without having to upload a new whiners page to my site not that i will always whine here but since i have the opportunity i suppose i could i could also leave the page absolutely blank and make people wonder what i was up to well maybe just my paranoid visitors most people probably would not care there is that word probably chances are you will not see that word typed on a page of mine often since my earliest bbs days i have cut that word down to prolly and it is become part of my speech i avoid saying lol during a conversation however i actually do laugh out loud well enough of this banter because there is prolly going to be more to follow i would love to know how you like the website and i would be pleased to share comments and criticism right here in an open forum if you would like thanks for reading bunni
1,i am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriends sexual assault of my oncebest friend my boyfriend of years and i both suffer from mental health issues and trauma i found out somewhat recently that months ago when my thenbest friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier i know what he did was horrible it makes me sick to my stomach to think that i was there and could not help it makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that i stayed with him on the other hand he himself is absolutely sick with guilt he is been having nonstop anxiety attacks crying spells and moments of catatonia and he cannot stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person i believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again he checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night i am also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been he has cheated on me before multiple times and i cannot help but ruminate on how if i were prettier this would not have happened and how it effects me one recent smaller time just happened and i have had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one furthermore i am selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me one of the few maybe only things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself i am also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified he posted his story to reddit and got mostly cautious support i posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert an enabler a shitposter and a terrible person he told his parents and one of the things they said was all three of you made mistakes unrelated but last night he posted a photo of us in the er and a girl who hates me replied ew you are back with her nonono what are you doing i have no idea what i have done to make everyone in my life hate me this much i do not have anyone left and i am scared to lose the one person that has stuck around so far
1,feeling numb has anyone else reached the point where they realise that they were emotionally numb in the past or still are now last year my grandfather passed away and it was a sad time for the family i was upset but no where near what i think i should have been i still have a hard time getting truly excited about things that should be fun like going back to uni and seeing friends etc it is hard feeling to describe dazed or aloof maybe if i do feel any emotional intensity it is anger or irritability
0,i used to eat strawberry chapstick when i was a kid when i say eat i am talking roll up the tube and take bites of it i also used to have tragically chapped lips i would always ask my dad for a new tube when we were in the checkout line of the grocery store and he kept buying them until he realized that no human can go through chapstick that quickly if you use it in the conventional way perhaps the fact that my lips could have been used as an alternative to sand paper gave it away and he soon found out about my snacking habits and refused to buy me anymore chapstick now many years later i have a slight obsession with chapstick and other lip products and if i may say so myself i also have wonderfully soft lips but i have recently concluded that the ingestion of strawberry chapstick has lead to my many neuroses we will get into them a little later i suppose they could have come from my parents divorce my moms abusive remarriage the teasing i endured at school some chemical imbalance or maybe even the time i crashed my tricycle and whacked my head on the concrete but i have decided i like blaming it on chapstick instead it was not until a few years ago that i realized i really did have some strange neuroses and that most other people have very few or even none in the last few months i have noticed that they effect me more that i ever thought i used to think oh that is just a quirk about me or hey everyone is a little crazy about some things i am not a lunatic by any means and most of my quirks are internal and really only effect me but because i know i was not always this way it has really lead me to wonder when does a person become who they are going to be and when is it too late to go back of course you can get some therapy or take some medication to rid you of many issues you may have but after you have grown and matured enough to even realize you have issues then would not any kind of intervention change who you are or force you to go through live pretending that you are someone else after you have been cured is a cure really just selfdenial about who you really are do you really want to do that

1,i kind of like being depressed after dealing with anxiety as a lot of people i have both depression and anxiety disorders basically a thing happened in july which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around october when i just transitioned into deep depression it was however a big relief i was completely empty i did not care about anything it was better to me than fucking anxiety when i am depressed i do not feel bad i do not feel good either but i am fine with that i do not feel anything it is kind of relaxing the downside when i was in the deepest state of depression i was really close to killing myself and i also threatened to shoot up the school after which police took me to a mental hospital i have been here for over months now i did some really bad things i acted really bad but on the inside i felt better when i am anxious i do not do mean things to people but on the inside i am dying i feel vulnerable and just want help i understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it i see what it does to people on this sub i just wanted to add my experience since it is different to everyone elses anxiety makes me feel like i am having a heart attack like i am going crazy i sweat i shake it feels literally like torture depression is the exact opposite it is calmness not giving a shit about anything basically relaxing i feel kind of comfortable being depressed i lie on the bed and look at the ceiling at the wall whatever like i am on autopilot right now i have both which just feels fucking weird i cannot even describe that sorry if i offended anyone i know some people prefer to feel something but i am fine with being an empty shell tldr depression gt anxiety for me

0,sputter sputter today todayyyy he hawi for the first time in many days felt alive today was the day when we in our business school got a business exercise to be brief the exercise involved our entire class to find such corporate executives in our city who were expatriates or executives of foreign origin and to hold your breath shadow them which meant we would have to observe them going about doing their job this whole exercise was to be completed in a span of hours and also required us not to spend any money on any form of hired aomutation which would now mean that we would have to go about the entire city which means many corporates hitch hiking with initial few hitches we all ultimately were off to our vaguely targetted destinations i chose to go to the office of the daimler chrystler india situated at the farthest end off the city i managed to reach the destination by hitch hiking snd managing some how aafrom then it was smooth sailing as i have my brother in law working with d c india upon entering the office of d c india i was interoduced to two of the german executives on deputation from germany i had a hour session with him as far as shadowing is concerned it was a complete no no with dc india as they said it was not a company policy to allow any such activity all set and done by the end of it all i managed to reach my b school campus on time we then had a session with our teacher to discuss the procedings of the day it was a wonderful learning experience and i would cherish this experience for times to come

1,anyone else hate talking about depression specifically because all the attempts at help feel fake guess stupid posting this all things considered but a moron anyway and besides that also looking just to see if alone in thinking this like at this point rather just hear comments from people who are also feeling down from others makes me fucking angry at them especially strangers because it do anything it make me feel better to be told will get it help to be told loved and in the event people bring up stuff like never get to have a yes this does happen as though that matters it makes me want to actually hurt them in real life i and but holy shit i even like when friends try to make me feel better anymore because it feels like they even get the point what sucks though is trying to get over that primal instinct to not kill myself i particularly want to live and i really want to live past but my dumb animal brain just thinks death and pain and let me do it kind of hoping that maybe instead i can get into an accident or just get really ill

1,do you ever feel like why bother all going to die anyhow and all accomplished and done will be forgotten i enjoy art but i often think why bother die one day and all my art work will be thrown away a lot i do enjoy but none of it serves any purpose after you go on vacation for example just left with the memories until you get old and forget it all sure it was fun at the moment but serves no long term purpose and one day even the memories will be gone they say enjoy life but why animals they just do what they do only purpose is to keep their species alive and technically our only purpose in life to keep our species going maybe if we spend so much time focusing on life and enjoying it actually be happier people and more accepting of pending doom i know just how i feel most of the time why i even bother to write this or anything else on reddit i know

0,acts but my life is worthless unless i use it for doing the work addignes me by the lord jesusthe work of telling others the good news about gods wonderful kindess and love unless i am living my life to do the work of god then my life is worthless not sharing christ s love with anyone and everyone is something that should make me feel guilty and i can honestly say that it does living christ is my title because i feel like i am supposed to live for him galations i myself no longer live but christ lives in me so i live my life in this earthly body by trusting in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me like what i said in the first one my life is worthless unless i use it to share gods love well i cannot do it alone so christ lives in me to help me and to guide me allowing god to live inside of me gives me a great deal of comfort how else could you feel more comfortable having the son of god inside your heart and knowing that he loves you and would do anything for you that is and amazing feeling and i am so glad that i get to experience it everyday
1,how do you talk about depression to your friends i am really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that i have acted with it and the way that i have so far failed to overcome its clutches this shame has led to me neglecting some relationships because i do not know how to talk about this without seeming really pathetic which makes me feel even more guilty for neglecting friends that i actually do value but just cannot bring myself to talk to so how do you talk about this in a way that seems i do not know like valid i do not know what to say i have been depressed and unemployed for over a year and now i have a friend calling me and i know that i should talk to them i even want to talk to them like they are awesome and i really really want them to be in my life again but the thought of trying to explain myself it makes me feel sick and disgusting to even contemplate what would you say does anyone have any good answers to this i really need advice right now
0,of course the first week went by not juz wnet by but with events that made me realised that teaching is no longer teaching firstly periods as a begining teacher really heavy more than double when compared to my practicum dayz but i took it in a good stride i took it more of a challenge and i have to live up to it what i am even more surprised is that i have to work more than hrs a day is this crasy or what the first week the only day that i managed to leave sch early was on fri which was to go for fridy prayers this is because on the and of july there were induction programmes for the new teahcers thus i was not able to prepare lessons for my coming day and i have to continue work at work at home till night this cycle stated on tues of june where the teahcers had a contact time thus my work load on tues was carried on to wed and wed to thurs and thurs to fri i feel unfair to my students because i personally think i could have prepared a more interesting lessons for them but then again when i think abt it the induction programme could have been carried out much ealier or during the holidays when we came back for the workshop where the entire induction programme could be squeeze into one day while i enjoyed my classes i love to go to class and present my lessons and see the kids literally grwo in terms of their knowlege and moral development thus i realised why there is a high percentage of teachers leaveing the work force because teaching is no longer teaching there are lots of admin stuff which begining teacher like me have to managed fortunately i have a very helpful department which keep in me check with the stuff that is going ard in the school like booking of the ava room or the computer lab despite all the heavy first week i look many new things which have kept my teahcing passion alive one of them is the love for the students seeing the ability to see them grow is something i feel no amount of money can buy i guess i need more time to get mysekf acustome to the sch policy and work culture we see how it goes in the second week then till then signing out wery and still hopeful begining teacher in amkss

1,i just do not know how to deal with this shit anymore i can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as years old now i am sure i have been happy some time along the way but i cannot remember i think most of the good times were just when i had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that i was normal and healthy unfortunately as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse and lasted longer i have dropped out of different colleges and have quit every job i have ever had most of them with literally no notice i have seen doctors i have been on different medications with no noticeable effects i am see a doctor now but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon but that could be a month or two away at this point i am just completely exhausted at this point and do not know how much longer i can take it my parent just keep telling me i need to get a job like that would make everything better it definitely does not help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if i have met any girls that i am interested in they cannot understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task they ask if i am suicidal as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is i do not consider myself suicidal but i no longer have a desire to continue living every day i wake up is another disappointment another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself i am pretty sure the main reason that i am not suicidal is that i am convinced that i would fail or just would not be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle as much as my family frustrates me i understand that they are trying to help but they just do not know how they have supported me financially on several occasions before now without their help i would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now all i want is to not feel this way anymore every time i leave my apartment i am tense and in fear of the people around me i escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless i can accept that i will always live with this illness that it is never going away i just want to find a way to make it bearable
1,people are not who they seem i originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me but i decided not to all i am saying is do not trust anybody you have zero assurance that people who act nice and fine when you are around are really nice and fine towards you when your backs turned i would not have known the true judgmental and frankly i have no fucking idea where in the ass of god did they pull all their judgmental shit if i had not snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people hell my own mothers in it too hide the knife he might stab our son my stepfather you are sick go to a doctor for a checkup you cannot give up please do not die we pity your son he cannot survive without you he will burn all the money with booze he will be homeless and sleep on the streets jesus fucking christ what in the actual fuck i do not even drink jesus christ what the fuck the judgment dear fucking christ i could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thoughtidea they came to suddenly i am back down to selfdoubt and i can feel depression clawing at me it is trying to rip me apart again but no more i am pushing it back i have confirmed everytime that family is my main source of toxicity fuck that i am being ganged up on by everyone in this house and their relatives and every single one of my relatives i once questioned if i was the one at fault i mean if everybody hated you you are probably doing something wrong unless you are just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole i have heard of those stories before so it is not impossible and i think that is the case with me jesus for now i am playing the game they want to play they want to be fake with me i will be fake with them i act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else i smile i joke all a facade so when the right time comes when i can finally burn bridges with them it will fucking hurt mom mom yes because everyone else would be glad i am gone but my mother will hopefully finally realize her fucking mistake and die a fucking failure of a mother

1,everythings just been hard to deal with lately i do not really know how to start this since i am kind of new to this subreddit and reddit in general but i guess i will try to say this all without embarrassing myself or something of the sort lately i have just been having a tough time especially since it is the last week before exams in my school i do not feel any pressure to be doing well at studies anymore but i do have one friend who does and occasionally he will ask for space or something during stressful times so that he does not end up lashing out at me but now it is just making me feel incredibly lonely i hate having to watch everyone else give hugs and stuff and just have a good time with their friends while i just keep having to give my friend space i get that we put this in place to avoid having feelings hurt but now it just feels restrictive it is all kind of hard to describe coherently and my mind feels all jumbled up tbh i just really want a hug at this point so i can stop feeling well lonely

1,ever have that moment where your depression teases you at the worst times then tricks you into making you think you are fine not sure how to explain it like you really start to feel like shit at certain points during the day but once you are near an item or person to communicate with e g a journal or counsellor you feel fine not the good fine but the nullity type of fine i do not know how to explain this and i do not like it because i want to be able to express this shit to the few trusted sources i have left
1,this is my first post i am and a half months pregnant dealing with depression anxiety i have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and i were trying to conceive my pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around i have an year old son i have had joint problems severe morning sickness and terrible depression anxiety my husband just does not understand what i am going through he thinks that i am being hateful or sad on purpose he contributes to a lot of the way that i feel he told me early in the pregnancy that if something was to happen and i lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it this was said to me because i was not taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness i could see if i were using drugs or drinking but i do not do those things i do not understand his thinking on that subject my mother in law is another person getting on my nerves she comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice she also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary i cannot talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the bad guy sometimes i just want to be alone away from people i feel like i do not have any privacy anymore my husband always makes me feel worse when i talk to him about how i feel i do not know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always says well you ought to be thankful rrblah rrblah rrblah it is not like i do not know that i could have it worse but he never cares what i feel at that moment i guess i better shut up i have ranted long enough although i feel like i could go on forever so sorry for the long post

1,trying to understand my depressed so i am sorry if i am posting in the wrong sub i just figured you guys could offer perspective so my so is away for work for more than a month but we are still in the same time zone lately he is been having bad episodes but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there i am proud to say that he said i was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help so okay so far so good when he has bad days sometimes he likes to check out of the world he also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me but we had a discussion before wherein i said i understand that you might need space but let me know if you are having a bad day and you are not in a chatty mood not sure if this was the right approach but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month and for the most part he is been open with me this weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence despite my check ins and despite not asking how are you questions for example we are both big footballsoccer fans so i tried to talk about the world cup he is a huge fan of the french team which won the cup nothing my anxious nature is making things more challenging because now i am thinking is it the depression or relationship issues my anxious self might pester him for answers but i am not sure if that is helpful so i am not sure how to go about this let him be and try not to freak out until he returns advice greatly appreciated thanks
0,blog short for we b log or just another stupid semiacronym invented for the c supposedly these blogs are the new journalism or the new voice of a generation just like the printing press in the telephone circa google telephone history you will see and cable tv in the early whatever i am not sure if this thing will come to any valuablerelevant end but i like to ramble in print and being too lazy to keep a journal this is perfect also hopefully this blog will allow me to argue with people i love to argue and if a good debate is presented then i may take the bate i may just use this to post my drunken ramblings but i may also use this blog for evil there are folks out there that need to be taken down a notch anyway for tonight peace
0,i am not a kerry fan i hate bush i will vote for kerry there i have said it kerry is not the doall and endall of the alternatives to bush the fact is he is the current alternative to bush i would prefer to be passionate about who i vote for as opposed to being passionate about who i will vote against unfortuately the person who stirs emotion in me for this election is bush and that is who i will be voting against the war in iraq has a little to do with my opinion but truth be told i liked bush less than i liked gore so gore got my vote gore stirred zero emotionfeeling in my bones while bush made my skin crawl the little scumbag liar gave me the creeps from the day the republican party announced him as their candidate i was not going to vote for him that being said the party that puts a strong candidate in the running will get my vote as it stands the parties are putting candidates out who they feel will offend the least that is crap we do not need products who are easy to advertise we need leaders who will do the best for america bushs entire tenure can be shown in a powerpoint presentation that fucker is on vacation more than anything else too bad the democrats cannot come up with a candidate who stirs more emotion than he is got to be better than bush

0,in law family vacation newborn my husband and i have been married since august i am now pregnant due in april we have been going on vacation with his parents for the last yrs with his sisters and last year their husbands too they assume that we will be going on vacation this year too the baby would be months old i do not want to go fyi his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me reasons i do not want to go we have lived with them for the past months i need a vacation from them i am used to my own space and being able to retreat i no longer really have that it will be a hr car ride with a four month old it may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride i just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for days that i do not even want to be at my husbands older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments we made some headway last year but i barely tolerate her and avoid her and really do not want to be stressed out for days because of it plus taking care of my baby everyone else does not see this or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive i do not even know why i have gone the last years as by the day i am drained i am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something i do not have to my question is how do i tell them we are not going my husband is backing me specially because i know my mil will resist do you guys think it is ok that i do not want to go
1,seeing doctor this week to talk about my depressive symptoms is it bad if i ask to be put on had some symptoms of depression for awhile no motivation always tired mood changes sadness etc been pretty reluctant to bring it up but finally decided i should see someone to try and break the cycle like to try being put on antidepressants and see if that helps me get back to feeling better about everyday life
1,can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure it just frustrates me so much and continues the perpetual cycle of well if i cannot make myself better through such simple actions i must be even more of a failure than i realised i appreciate the science behind it releasing endorphins yada yada but if i cannot bring myself to drink water or get out of bed how am i supposed to go for a jog if i am so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better where do i find the energy to go for a hike when being awake for three hours makes my body physically ache i get it it is helpful for a lot of people but telling me to go get my yoga pants on and be at one with nature will not cure a thing and by repeating that useless mantra you are making me worse rant over i am going back to bed edit a few people telling me if i exercise i will lose weight and feel better about myself i only need to try it apparently on the advice of my doctor i have tried it even walking i do walk every day no matter how i feel i also do not need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason i am depressed because i am not overweight just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra as if it is the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that has nothing to do with how often i move flex or jump my point is that it is not working

1,i am weakest at night i do not understand the reason for this but for as long as i can remember i have always been weakest during the night time i feel weak mentally emotionally physically internally i feel like i cannot go on like i cannot keep fighting like i have had enough i freeze over my body locks up my fear paralyzes me and my mind becomes my enemy night seems endless because i cannot see much of anything no matter where i try to look from minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like i am nothing but an insignificant prey who is time has come i am exhausted and need sleep but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while i am immobile by unconsciousness and yet though a part of me yearns for light for the warm comfort of the sun it only depresses me in the light i can see what i truly am i can see a reflection of something i have grown to hate when i look at my reflection i want to smash the mirror so i can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence in the light i can see everyone else either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance or i see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange and possibly a cruel comfort i hate seeing others suffer but i am so insignificant i am helpless that i might as well be dead i need the light and yet it hurts me
1,can we talk about comments for a minute this subreddit has helped me so much and it has helped thousands of people just the same it is supposed to be a place of understanding and help but when i see comments saying tough luck boo hoo poor me or anything of the sort i just infuriates me to the extreme if you are not here to help or be helped then simply leave this community is for helping those in need not for trolling or for laughing at it is seriously sick that people would be so cruel to others when they did not ask for anything but help if you are not here to help leave simple as that

0,why does my mom keep talking to me she says i am not nice like i used to be she was like the older i get the more understanding i should be she also feels like i should seek wealth but that is not something i want i want personal growth and wisdom and strength i know a lot may disagree and say money is what matters yes it does but it is a tool also i do dislike my mother because she messed up my head as i grew up she always told me her issues parents should never tell kids their issues i am now and she feels like she can still change the way i am but in my opinion the first three years is what shapes most of a person i want to move out i want to buy a bike a tent and a sleeping bag and leave what do you guys think

1,i believe much depression is about a lack of hope i do not want to die i just want to stop existing sound familiar people just want to end the tedium the suffering of being conscious but most people would be depressed if not for a goal i think most people would rather not exist than exist if solely to pick cotton in the sun or mine in poor conditions but people who are not depressed do these things because there is a goal a reward afterwards there is a reason to be alive when what is the point is part of your mental vernacular and nothing brings a smidge of happiness anymore that driving force disappears and all it leaves is a depression

1,intense feelings of not wanting to exist wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever i am a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school i have been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that felt like i had a purpose in life however now entering university i feel like i have no purpose no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression i fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself but i just feel like i am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow i think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it i feel like i do not have any actual friends even though i go out a lot and i feel like i have no impact on other peoples lives like they can go on so easily without me being there on top of that i feel like i do not belong anywhere since leaving highschool i feel like i do not have a place in college even though i got into my first choice school however i am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting i really want to go someplace where i can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything this is mostly just a flood of thoughts that are always in my head but i just wanted to give my two cents to see if anyone relates to these thoughtsfeelings

0,i want to lose friendship of years but i think going that way hi guys i usually do this but i literally feel like i have nowhere else to vent ok i have been friends with this person for years since we were teenagers we both clicked over time through going to the same school and i really liked her personality we ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and i let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to after graduation spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much though we have met up when been back so the last time i saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching months ago since then we have occasionally talked but been me sending messages more than her the last time we skyped was months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when i asked her for some advice about a trip i was going on i then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as i want to bother her if she was busy started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk she saw my messages but reply so i left it another week i sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply i have tried not to bother her if busy and have stressed to her that i want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late january and basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding the thing is i am racking my brain and trying to think what i could have done to upset her if anything and i think of anything i have questioned whether getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason the thing is i have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore it be easy for me as she is one of the only few people i still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other but if for some mysterious reason cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can i do i basically sent her a message saying i try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that i feel like i may never hear from her again and it really hurts but what can i do if something there anymore then just not there a something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit

0,how should i deal with this flaky friend i have a friend who i totally love who always flakes whether the plans are big or small of the plans we make initiated by her often end up with i do not feel like going out or i made other plans or i do not remember making these plans etc this is super annoying and all but it is not the whole problem since she is super flaky i always call her out on it or joke about it for example in our group chat another friend will make plans and she will be like ok its set and then i will reply like that only means it is half set and i know i am being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake right anyway i guess it really annoys her when i do this so she confronted me about it calling me a bitch for always making jokes about her being flaky and asked me not to do it anymore i agreed but i kind of wish i did not and now i feel like not even replying when we talk in our group chat i am sure making snarky comments about someone being a flake cannot be anywhere near as annoying as constantly being flaked on right there is been some huge plans that she flaked on including travel and birthday plans that really upset me especially since she is such a good friend and it means a lot to me for her to make it to those special occasions does anyone have any advice on how to move forward should i just pretend it never happened and continue like usual or should i saydo something what is your experience with friends like this

1,i can absolutely relate to what you are going through i understand how difficult it is adjusting to so many different personalities ten people in one apartment is overwhelming to say the least i used to live with four other girls who had diverse interests and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities it was best that way in your case it seems like you are making as much effort as you can to be social there is no need to go out on a limb to prove that you are not antisocial when i had depression i really needed my space and the last thing i wanted to do was socialize with my roommates luckily i am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now it has helped enormously i wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself i did that in my year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list and i was able to get my own living space by november even though the moving was a hassle i never regretted it as for finding ways to spend time away from the noise of other people i usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus i go there every weekend to relax and read it is away from campus life and it has helped me sort out my thoughts the suggestions made by others such as the library and a park are wonderful too maybe you can purchase a bus pass i have depression and social anxiety so it was difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own i made only a couple of friends who have since moved on or graduated i too saw a school counselor but it was shortlived what helped me other than getting away from campus was getting some online support from forums such as this one i also kind of clung to one friend at a time instead of many groups of people i would go to the movie theatre and watch something funny or i would take long walks you are not alone hang in there and keep posting if you feel really down i think this forum is very supportive and people will try to help you the best way they can
1,has your family always ignored your problem i think the hardest part of being depressed since i was a kid is how absolutely ignored i wasam by my family my parents split up when i was and my father died when i was my family completely sweeped it under the rug like i was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home i walked around sad slumbered over quiet avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me the only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who i should live with after divorce my mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering i do not ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume i am ungrateful and spoilt i have had everything they sent me to school fed me put clothes on my back what else could i possibly need i do not want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just i feel so abandoned

0,should i support my bestfriends toxic relationship my bestfriend has been dating a guy for the last years since they were in high school she has grown into a gorgeous and successful woman while he is still acting like he is she has been in therapy because of trust issues with her boyfriend for years she continually tells me all the terrible things he does and how he lies non stop i obviously want her to feel like she can talk to me about the relationship but i am getting tired of watching her go through the same thing over and over again and then the next day they make up they see each other once a week or less he cannot afford a cell phone or a car he drinks a lot and he is just a loser in my eyes he is lazy and waste his money on alcohol and smokes she could throw a rock and find a better boyfriend but she is so invested in this relationship its disgusting she wants to marry this guy eventually and her excuse is that he just needs to grow up a bit he is she literally gives him chance after chance and he continues to screw up but she is so set on being in the relationship i know she is more then likely scared of being alone but after years of him screwing up you think being alone would be better then being in this one sided relationship i have no idea what to do i am scared if i tell her that i do not want to hear anymore about this guy then ill be a bad friend but i also cannot stand by while this guy continues to treat her like shit and she continues to take it what would you do would you be honest or would you stick by your friend and continue biting your tongue

1,i cannot seem to be happy with my current life only the future so i was diagnosed with mood swingsmild depression quite a while ago and have been on a small dose of fluoxetine prozac most of my life now based on looking at objective measures i should be feeling pretty content right now but i cannot seem to be happy about it and only about the things that i hope i will work towards in the future i guess for example i have lost a little over pounds since february the first significant time i have actually lost weight and i am now no longer medically obese but i still just feel fat and have not been able to feel anything good about the weight i have actually lost i have a great job and am just about to finish paying off all my loans but i do not feel any accomplishment in that either i keep thinking maybe i will feel good when i have enough to put down a downpayment on a house but i doubt that will be the case i have a bunch of great friends but i am tired of being single again i know that i should just focus on the good things right now but it has not seeming to be any consolation my faith life has been doing pretty good recently too especially compared to the past but i still feel like a shitty person a lot i do not know i know that so many other people are having a rough time and i should be happy with how things are going but i am just down right now
0,letter to dad christian fatherhood author kent nerburn once wrote is much easier to become a father than to be one this rings true even for those men who really want to be a father with enough hard work and determination we can master a career a hobby or a sport but it is difficult to even control anything in fatherhood let alone master it when the baby starts crying how do we make her stop when our son starts failing classes in school how do you motivate him and help him with both the drive and the subject matter fatherhood is slow and daunting work read more at
1,trying to get communication back with my best friend i have an idea it be easy and it may never work but worth a shot long story short been depressed and i have a friend i could make a paragraph story about my friend and my depression but i want to get to the point i want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it my friend made the decision to stop communication with me until i go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar the thing is been in one already it was a pretty flexible place cell phones were allowed doors were never locked etc long story short i became high and am not allowed back and i want to go back i believe in happiness by mental health i believe in natural happiness i believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy so anyways i fulfill his wish but getting communication back with him is all i want there are no exceptions so my idea just for fun i livestream games on youtube i do it for fun not for fame i play those popular games i play the ones that no one plays unlikely for a video to get more than views but considered starting a new channel i will livestream games post videos about my custom guitar hero songs i do that for fun too and just pretty much show that having fun but the big goal of the channel will be to my friend be the whole idea that will be written on every video what the channel art will say think of it as a gofundme only not asking for money asking for support from the public to hear my story hear what doing and to be there with me when my friend does deliver the catch for obvious reasons his name will never be revealed no one will have any idea who my friend is but little by little i will try to reveal the channel to him start with the channel being named then sooner or later add my last name as time goes on try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything the big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel and with whatever support there is he will see how much mentally improved over however long it takes this all may sound totally silly totally bogus yeah maybe this will never work in a million years just a wild thought that going to attempt anyways i might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here
0,did i do the right thing hello reddit first of all i want to begin this by saying that english is not my first language so please do forgive me if i make mistakes here and there let us get straight to the point i am in highschool grade i have known my best friend since grade yknow it was that kind of nice pleasant friendship i was always there for her she was always there for me even travelling togheter laughing with tears told me many times that i am her only true friend etc etc and everything seemed to be alright until she got a boyfriend she started to ignore even get mad me me as to why i do not text it first well why does it matter so much who texts first seems like a childish thinking in my opinion i told her that i cannot be the only person that talks in this friendship so she told me she will text me first she never did but i saw it coming anyway i realized that for her it did not matter whether i am next to her or not she is so apathetic almost to the point where it hurted me but i decided to let go focus more on myself study more read more invest in my own hobbies and so on so i was doing these i started learning more things about myself discovering things i did not know about until now and all of these happened because i decided to leave her she noticed this behaviour of mine and actually started talking to me but it would not matter anyway because it was an endless cycle all she sees now is her boyfriend i think the only reason she goes to school is just to see him nothing else as i look back at our past which is kind of sorta tragic and i do not want to into detail i realized that i was the only one who truly cared i always cried for her i wonder if she cried for me at least onceshe blocked on me on our social medias for the stupidest reasons she thought i was annoyed because she was talking too much about her boyfriend and somehow i was but i did not want to show it but what did she accomplish by blocking me for almost a month anyway could not she talk to me about it at least i told her in the most sincere way that i missed her very much through that period of time and even started worrying crying in the middle of the night her response was short and dry as usual i got fed up starting to blame myself because i always accepted all of her bullshit i broke our friendship leaving her confused and perhaps angry at me i just started ignoring her and she noticed this did i do the right thing we have not talked for almost weeks
0,should i attempt to repair our friendship one last time so a few months ago a close friend and i had a sort of fight because i made a shitty passive aggressive comment i apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it even apologised more a day later anyhow they said they needed some space we happened to work together and sit right next to each other so i left them be for awhile they basically refused to even look or speak to me after a month or so this started to take its toll on me emotionally and mentally i was not equipped to deal with it so eventually after days of this something i could not get away from i snapped and out of desperation as i was losing my mind i told i am walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed so that is where it ended they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work they eventually left to go to a new place even at the farewell i was ignored till the last minutes then got some communication after that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group completely unexpected sadly this confused the shit out of me and i drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt then i was blocked i have since not contacted them in any way for over a month do i make another attempt and how would i word it or should i just leave it and see if anything happens we were really close and i feel awful about hurting them it was the only argument in a year and a half we had
0,started attending this yoga class at the fitness center on wednesday nights i figured it would be a good way to gain more flexibility strength i have to admit a lot harder than i anticipated and that kind of pisses me off here i thought it would be a nice from my regular workout routine in the middle of the week i am pretty flexible and since not straightup cardio i assumed it would be easy not so much actually pretty challenging to continually switch hold all of those poses and it turns out not as flexible as i thought i was particularly horrible at the balancing portion of the class i look like i stopped off somewhere for happy hour before showing up however i do enjoy the challenge so i plan to keep going i just know it will take some time before i feel any sort of euphoria from it
1,does trading help your depression maybe i am a bit weird in this regard but i do quiet well in this regard i have not traded too much because of life circumstances and thus the past few years have been depressed as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism i also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex i have been thinking stuff over and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy i feel like whenever i am trading i am on fire and feel like my true self whereas otherwise i feel blah when i mean trading i mean medium term investing based on value investing idk if the risk and reward part overruns me but when i think about that i do not think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks i focus on kicking ass and taking names anyone else ever get a feeling like that idk if this is taking on risky behavior for the sake of it or merely finding my muse

1,just cut off all of my friends and feeling alone and regretful posted this to but i think that the right place for it i just cut ties with nine people who i considered for almost years their negativity and inability to understand what working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead i was being anchored and every time i felt i was getting out of it i was pulled back down fact that i was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them i want anything to do with them they understand that in order for me to become a doctor i have to commit a lot of time to my studies but if i show up to something such as drinking i get absolutely torn apart by them like they hate when productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit told me that a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and just too hard to even reason with them at this point did i over react and should i iron things out with them just since i was so attached to them i know how to deal with this situation had so many good times and years with them but lately been so difficult

1,love is what makes the ride worthwhile without love why suffer through anything at all for what gain i have had love and i lost love love is so powerful a feeling its a state of being a person always has within him to very different personalities that is you without love and you while in love in love i am full of goals ideas glass half full my bank account may be low but it does not effect me i can deal with anything while in love i am more confident while in love i loved to buy her little gifts make desserts for her clean the room so she can relax after a long day shower with her and wash her body and of course fuck out of love i am still in love with her but we can no longer be together i am scared of the world now constantly battling anxious thoughts and worries i spend my days now trying to stay above water to not drown in the depression but no matter how well i swim that day the pull is still my depressive state everyday it is like i am staring into a black abyss that probably goes down infinitely it is hypnotic and my main goal for the day is to pretend that this gaping exist actually does not exist within me so that is just what is been on my mind lately my new normal

1,journal entry monday december just thought i would share my thoughts from last night i occasionally lurk reddit looking for a relatable story so i figured i would share some of my own thoughts i do not want a job the hardest part of having a job is talking it is bad enough that i have to make eye contact having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking meeting new people is also tough it is even tougher when you are the new one who are these people do i even want to know you are you going to try and get to know me am i going to allow it customers are easier to deal with but just a drag to have to deal with it can be monotonous often annoying but all the while i just feel drained there are good days at work but there are also bad days and those bad days make the lasting impression in my experience i am thankful for those good days but the bad days remind me that i want better for myself i am tired of working in restaurants i am tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under i am tired of repeating phrases i am told to repeat i am tired of seeing the disgusting process of how shitty food is prepared i am tired of cooking something i enjoy feeling soulless historically preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act at least to me the commoditization of it is a bit of a shame i detest consumerism generally speaking customers are not my favorite people along with restaurants i hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job i really do not want any job when it comes to time amp energy vs money i am all for the money until i find out what i have to do then my my time amp energy feels more valuable because it is more valuable

1,i thought things were getting better sorry for the little rant i just needed to say this somewhere after recently getting out of the hospital for another attempt at my life i was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me for a couple days this almost gave me a high thinking that maybe i really am glad i was not able to go through with it or that maybe i was beating these years of depressiveness not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward i fantasize about what i could have done differently to have made sure i died that night going forward i thought i would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again yet the only thing i can think of is them knowing i tried killing myself and that i have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them i will now be treated with care and people will be on guard around me and i did not want to do that to them this semester has started again and i have already missed the first week and while part of me just wants to drop everything i cannot afford to start paying back the loans i just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all tldr trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder

1,am i depressed or is this just my personality the littlest things get to me a small criticism here a misread facial cue there most likely i am reading too much into things but idk how to change my way of thinking i dwell on them i cannot let them go i can sulk for weeks on what a regular person would forget in an hour does this sound like depression or has my confidence been so damaged that this is just how i percieve the world now because of these percieved inadequacies my thoughts have begun to worry me i do not want to hurt myself but i feel like i am teetering on the precipice of having one bad enough day to push me over the edge therapy scares me as it puts a giant damaged stamp on your forehead but at the same time i cannot do this on my own anymore i am not really looking for a fix i just want to know i am not alone

0,hmm lol well i cannot really say that this is my first time writing a blog i have done it before but failed miserabley my other site that i was running and maintaining sorta died when decided to kick me off for not having like a gazillion visitors a month oh and because my account was free p well i better start writing about yesterday well this is going to be interesting p i worked from and had like a min break at about since i had to ride to work coz my brother was being a wanker and did not want to drive me i parked my bike around the back of the building without a chain which i forgot so at about i decided that i would check if my bike was still around the back of the building where i parked it well to cut an extremely long story short it was not and after alot of screaming and alot of profanities being used i ended up vending my anger into the nearest wall which happened to be concrete it would have been alot better if it had been marshmallow or something otherwise i would not have like a knuckle the size of kansas at the moment now would i d after this i went back inside and worked the next min till i finished my mum picked me up and thought that since i rode to work she would be picking up the bike aswell but no after an extremely heated discussion more like we were ripping eachothers heads off we decided to go down to the police station about min drive awa and report the bike stolen when we were reporting the details to the nice constable he immediately jerked his head up and said oh is this yours i then had to walk down a long hallway and he then revealed the bike and to my joy i replied yes yes that is my bike since mum had gone home to get changed because when she picked me up she was in her slippers we now had the smaller car because mum believed that we had no chance in the world of finding my bike we had to really cram my bike into the little family car i went home and slept well toodles i shall be back writing about my interested day oh and if your wondering were i work i work at hungry jacks junkfood cornerbye
1,anyone else read books as a form of escapism i know for some people depression can be so crippling that you even find the motivation to pick up a book let alone focus long enough to read it that used to be me although always been interested in reading and loved it until my depression became that crippling but since getting put on adderall for my add able to get back into reading books mostly fantasy books it helps me literally be in another world for a while and forget about my problems for a while and feel like living another life for a while not a cure obviously for depression but it does seem to help me a little temporarily anyone else have a reading habit or have found reading to be helpful in this way and if so what do you like to read
0,i cannot forgive her no matter how hard i try i am focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing namely with my grandmother i am currently staying with her but thankfully i am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next months or so i have stayed on and off the last several years and before i became an adult i lived with her from birth we have a complicated relationship although i appreciate the things she has done for me and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food i like etc i cannot seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment i feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me i understand no one is perfect adults am not always ideal role models to kids but my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child she would often act like i was her partner in crime in the absence of a husband and made me feel responsible for her happiness she would try to talk bad about my mom so i would not favor her my mom was not living with us and had mental issues she would give me the cold shoulder or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if i happened to act like i wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood it confuses me because i think deep in my heart i do want a happy relationship with her or maybe i try so hard out of guilt knowing she has tried to make it up to me i guess but every so often i implode and i tell her how much she bothers me or even that i hate her sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation i feel terrible about it and like i am a monster i always feel guilty when she tells me you are the only one who is really special to me you are the only one i have she does not have a close relationship with mom her other d or siblings maybe i get angry because to me this does not feel normal it feels like i am being trapped i am seeing a dbt therapist but we am not making progress about this yet i just wish this was not my life i am not looking for solutions per say just sympathy or someone who also understands it is so exhausting
1,i made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years this is based on all the posts on my throwaway account this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through since i think it is noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative while going back over these posts from so relatively long ago i noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger if it were somebody else saying those things about me it would be called harassment but it was me saying those things about myself all in all this has really made me realize that all the things i have written about myself are way offbase and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode i know somethings wrong but i do not know what to do about it in some ways i am sure i will always think this way about myself regardless of what i do but i wish there were an easy way to manage it i used this word cloud generator cheers

1,loneliness is just so crippling i just cannot handle it myself and there is no one i can realistically ask for help because i just need so much more help than anyone can give and i do not have nearly enough people to spread out the burden i just do not seem capable of finding anyone who actually wants to be a real friend to me i just feel so incredibly sad because i feel alone and i cannot do anything about it

1,i really need help talking with someone i have no one to talk to
1,my best husband shot himself friday night angry he was a manly man all of us all of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world in a house that thought mental health professionals were quacks he thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak this was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented so mad at him for leaving my best friend a year old widow at the people who raised him at society for telling him weak to take medicine at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid senseless waste guilty for not trying to do more heartbroken that never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful confused by the events leading up to it i just need help i know what to do spending most of my time with my best friend and trying to be strong and give comfort where i can i know what the point of this post is any words of wisdom advice thoughts stories would be very welcome thanks for reading
1,any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend last thing i need right now is the pain but i think i have to i have posted here a few times before and never got much for replies which is ok i really do hope i can get some insight on this particular issue however for so long i have been completely alone and it really sucked i managed to connect with my cousin a couple of years ago and we have had a lot of great times but more often than not lately it seems i feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out we have hung out like times a week for a couple years now i feel like we have a real connection but she does not show it if she feels the same i am an alcoholic and so is she so we drink together a lot i certainly would be able to quit if i did not have to drink to be around her besides the booze i have no idea what other drugs she is into i know coke for sure probably smoking crack time to time she is made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night she is constantly lying to me about everything she is so very unreliable in the last weeks twice now she is made plans with me for the next day only to show up on facebook at like after i have been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit everything is always about her she is even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills i do so most of the time it is just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her if i try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject i know she is not really a friend more of a company prostitute if anything it seems like i am always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back i know i am being blatantly used but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time she actually ghosted me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place i had to check into the psych ward i was in such a rut over it when we finally started hanging out again she did not seem to care at all the pain it caused me and i still have never heard an answer why she would block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue i feel like she is getting worse and no matter how hard i try i cannot help her or make her seem to care i do not think i can handle the pain of losing my friend again i also have ocd and i obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time i suppose i actually came here hoping people would tell me not to ditch her but i know i cannot keep letting her treat me like this how do i do it on good terms how do i get over it and not let the grief consume me please help
0,experience angry sibling i have a sister who will tell you she is the most laidback of us all but the truth is her anger will zoom from zero to in the blink of an eye when we converse she will criticize or take exception with something i have said and i have to gently remind her that i am only telling her how i feel i am not disagreeing with her opinion or whatever thing is it is getting more and more difficult to talk with her as it seems as though anything sets her off these days and while i have nothing at all against bill burr i actually think he is hilarous talking to her is like trying to talk back to one of his onstage rants understand because he is ranting to be funny but she actually means what she says i love this sister and am closer to her than many of the five sisters i have but i am beginning to point this out to her because i do not think she realizes the way she sounds almost everything is said in a confrontational or defensive tone of voice and i just do not understand why should i suggest therapy antidepressants or antipsychotics a shrink
1,i might be feeling this way because i demand too much from myself i made a similar post about how it could be a sleep problem but i have a lot of thoughts in my head so let me share this and comment if you think you relate basically i do not want to settle for what my life is right now i do not want to accept a cheap easy job i do not want to accept my poor mental health and i do not want to take any of the medicine i am given i do not want to live with my parents i think my moms not smart and my stepdad has always been an angry alcoholic i remember the feeling that he hated me ever since my childhood but then i think he has trouble understanding people i do not want to be any of the things i hate and i became very hateful ever since that feeling and the mind fog started i do not know i felt like i would type more but it all revolves around money and things i hate about myself and other people i just hate the life i have i feel like i am in a terrible mindset it is a mindset that does not let me grow but makes me think i should try as hard as i can to i also feel insufferably tired lately hence the sleep issues post on
1,why why do i feel this way why am i always tired all the time why cannot i get out of bed in the morning take a shower and be productive i want to do so much but i just do not seem to care or have the motivation anymore a year has passed and everything is the same i am living the same day over and over again and i do not know how much longer it will last why am i always in my own head i am always thinking about the past just wishing i have done things differently or even did things at all if only i made other decisions in life maybe i would not be where i am now tired and alone why am i like this why was i put into this life of emptiness and failure i just want it to stop but at the same time this is all i know and i just have to except it i guess

0,i have got to go watch my favorite television shows so i will be brief as a conservative i am more than a little fed up with the liberal bias in the media disgusted is not really the right wordi am disgusted with the blatant antiamericanism of the flagburning war protestors i am disgusted with the selfabsorbed corruption at the unbut the media bias it can best be compared to a child singing an annoying song incessantly over and over again they are aware that they are injecting bias into their news they are aware that it is wrong however they are not going to stop doing it because on one level the annoying songsinging child enjoys singing the song on another it enjoys annoying the people around it eh that is the best comparison i can come up with on such short notice perusing the internet a couple of years back i came across this wonder of wonders the blog conservatives around the nation had taken opportunity of this new miracle of technology to protest the liberal media good for them since then both the media and the celebrities around the nation have turned up the heat on their criticism of bush all the while proclaiming that there was a chill wind of repression silencing them such sheer pretentiousness on their part served to give me a headache for a few hours but nothing more however they have begun to go to far they have gone beyond the realm of bias into the realm of propaganda i realized this after i was able to deconstruct the basis of a time magazine article how we got homeland security wrong with a calculator access to google and no more than five minutes of my own time when something like this happenswhen a trusted and widely read magazine starts putting out bullshit that can be disproved with eighthgrade research and math skills well things have gotten pretty bad instead of sitting around and bitching about it i have decided to throw my weight into the fight by starting this blog whenever i can i will point out liberal media innaccuracies whenever i want to i will write opinion pieces however unlike the mainstream media i will be honest with you this blog will be replete with rightwing bias ranging from moderate to as the media would put it extreme thank you

1,when people ask you what you did for the weekend or for your birthday etc i have no idea how to respond my emotions have become so numb that i cannot feel anything so therefore i cannot enjoy anything i used to like doing i literally just go to work everyday for hours come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding there is nothing i can enjoy so when someone asks me what i did i just say some crap like i just relaxed at home or something i do not know what else to say it is the worst part about depression for me not being able to enjoy anything i do not even look forward to coming home from work because it is not like i have anything to enjoy at home it is all the same dullness i would probably work hours a day seven days a week if i could because it would not bother me at all i am not missing out on anything too bad they do not because they do not want to pay overtime for me of course
1,i just love sleeping just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket everythings dark and my bodys resting i wish i could be there all my life i dream sometimes but normally i do not dream and that is when i am the happiest i just feel like i am dead and have no problems just the ritual of wrapping myself and then getting comfortable is the only thing to make me smile i then daydream and in that state where i am conscious but not enough to acknowledge my problems i fall asleep but then there comes tomorrow and sometimes i wish i could have stayed awake all night to avoid waking up and facing reality but then i remember i love sleeping sadly it is another day and i have to get out of bed
1,i feel like spiraling downwards losing people and do anything about it or do the wrong things just searching desperately for someone to care before too late this summer has just flown by i work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes i spend every moment i can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times not as much as like my best friend is stationed overseas and while i have a close group of friends known for years literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere when they are gone going to be all by myself been so lonely lately too just wanting someone to care about me i had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year and i just regret it all the time i drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness but it makes it worse this summer has already just been shitty but at least my friends are around like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point no matter how hard i try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and always left on read or stood up on plans the other night i got drunk and did something never done before and that was cut myself honestly i feel like i did it to see if i could and how it would make me feel i guess i still know how it does but i was disappointed in myself i let it get so far i know i just feel like this year has just been me slowly losing the only things that make me happy

0,i went over to my brothers yesterday evening to give him a demo of knoppix it was a cd which i got with my dutch magazine pcactive the version is his impression before putting the cd in was that linux was overall much to difficult to learn after all he had been using windows since he has a pc which is a fair few years now when the kde desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up he did not have to say anything i could hear him think wow we had a look through the main menustructure and just ran a few programs mozilla kmail kstars the control centre he was simply impressed i have to say even from the cd knoppix is fast and reliable he is now going to play around with the cd for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by in a couple of weeks days i expect a request to make him a permament install on his harddrive he had just had a lot of virusrelated problems and his windowsbox had grind to a halt a couple of days ago he was very interested in learning that with this operating system no more of that would happen he was also worried he would not be able to do the things in linux he did under windows but after showing him this was no longer an issue oh by the way there is a new version of knoppix read all about it on the urllink knoppix website

1,hi i am dad a new member today i like what i have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others it is so hard to look at yourself especially when wearing the dark glasses of depression i am a man in my late educated with family wife and two great smart loving kids and i will try to summarize my story about yrs ago i was laid off tech field it was very hard to find another good position we were so spoiled i was making in the past few years we took it for granted we built new houses since and did well we enrolled our kids in a private christian school a high priority for us then my wife was in a auto accident and has spinal damage she is mobile but has chronic pain she is also suffering from depression i managed to find another job but it was a very dysfunctional place i had to take a few leaveof absences then i became pegged as a weak person they eventually let me go for too many loas i am paying for cobra we cannot do this forever the pressure just adds to my anxiety after seeing my psychiatrist he took me through many medicines and even ects we tried for three years to find the most effective drug presently i take zoloft cymbalta lamictal xanax valium for anxiety i also have osteopenia bone density loss so i take fosamax and tylenol narcotic for backjoint pain lastly i use soma for muscle strain i do not know if the medicines are helping me or adding to the problem i admit i lean on some of the medicines as a coping mechanism i have had so many situational events in the last few years i suspect my depression is more environmentally caused i seem to ruminate on the bad events of the past too much i am stuck and just cannot seem to get aggressive at my job hunt we just sold our bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment i feel guilty that my family has to go through this i know that i have skills and experience but i do not have the self confidence my ego is on the floor my sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food and sex is gone my wife is getting frustrated with me and does not always build me up her depression has her down too with two depressed parents it is very difficult to support each other i feel stuck and do not know what to do sometimes i just feel like giving up any comments or thoughts would be appreciated
1,lonely aka hard making friends as an adult i have some friends not a whole ton but it seems they never want to talk or hang out i know busy but just lonely hard making friends as an adult
1,i am a mess and i need to rant every so often i will find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life i will start exercising and eating healthy and pushing myself to talk to people and i will actually feel pretty good for a few days then i just stop i will wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because i cannot commit to the simplest of things this is probably the fourth time it is happened in the past year i made some really bad choices today regarding food which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body nobody could ever convince me that it is not this past bought of motivation i tried to convince myself that i was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health but in the back of my mind i knew the only real reason was because i wanted to lose weight and now here i am completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression all i want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep i do not have a job or the desire to have one and i lost most of my friends because i never talked to them i live with my mom who i thought i could talk to about anything but i feel like i cannot tell her about how bad it is gotten it does not help that she tells me everyday that i need to get a job i know she is right but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because i have never held down a job for more than months if i got a job right now i would probably have a breakdown and quit the first week i went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that i did not i thought it was all about doing hair but it turns out it is all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product i know my outlook on the world is fucked up but i do not know how to change myself it is like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull i just feel like i am stuck and any move i make is the wrong one sorry this is all over the place i am just really deep into it right now and needed to vent

0,why hello there is it normally this difficult to start one of these things i am trying not to plunge into a sea of various results of hallucinogenics straight away so instead i am going to approach the problem of how i am going to start this thing off but i guess i already have well that was easy i suppose i should introduce myself hi i am laura shakes hand i am thirteen and i live in a large town or small city but hey the glass is half full called livingston which is in scotland located near the capital i was born on the of september which makes me a libra the most utterly boring sign in the zodiac i go to a catholic high school st margarets r c academy which i like to refer to as the convent i am in fact a baptised catholic although i would not say that was my religion as i do not practice it unless that couple of times that i picked up the bible when i was in a contradicting everyone mood counts actually you could say that me and god have some issues to work out i suppose you could call me an atheist although i did mess about with magik for a while this is like my seventh attempt at a diary as i just seem to start them get bored and then move on to start another one but as you are my diary you are required to have a name see at least the diary of anne frank inspired me in some way and you shall be called tai i like that name i got it off of rhyan who wants me to me called tai when i become a transexual personally i would rather be named bert that is a masculine name i tried to look up tai on a names and meanings website to enlighten myself onh the wisdom behind it this is my result name tai origin chinese meaning very big thatll do me wink hum is not it ironic how i have just spent about an hour setting up this account and fixing my profile to look all nice and when i start writing my first ever entry i get writers block oh speaking of irony my friend sian and i were in bathgate on monday and as we were walking to the chippie an nhs van drove past us and the driver was smoking well this seems like a sufficient introduction so i am away laughing on a fast camel entry closed

1,losing my mind at so the best label i can put is depression i know if that is what really going through tho long story short i grew up in a pretty bad environment had a single mother now that older i understand stand that it must of been hard being a single mom but what i was put thru is still no excusewho was very abusive verbally and physically i remember having brooms broke across my back and head for simply spilling a drink when i was i was stabbed by mother and was taken to the hospital of course like many children who are abused i did not speak up i guess because of fear but more because i want to be looked at like a sick puppy over the years i was able to cope with my environment and it became normal the part that i understand is when i was i decided to leave and with no real support i was homeless for a bit i used to set daily goals for myself so i let depression set in like find a job etc i bought a car with the little money i had and slept in that and went to the gym to shower strangely enough that is when i was at the most happiness i have ever felt flash a year later have an apartment a good job and have the whole world in front of me but not happy and been a year now and feel like i have no drive and think about ending my life everyday i just simply feel numb or like i am not connected to body i also mention that i have siblings and i think about them all the time i think that a terrible person for leaving them to live in that environment when free enjoying life anytime i feel joy instantly sucked from me because i began to think about my siblings and think what they are going thru right now i wonder if they love me or hate me and its been taking a toll on me physically and mentally and at this point i know what to do i tried reaching out because that would mean i would have to see my mother and no longer afraid of her she simply deserve to see me at all i sometimes think when on her deathbed will she ever feel any remorse for what she has done i also think when she goes to take her last breath will she wonder about me she seen me since i left and she ever again any thoughts on what i should do
1,it is been so long since i have been here doubt anyone would remember me lots has been happening my job has become busier so i have become more exhausted when i get home and i just do not want to do anything then on march my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece his only daughter then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly we took him into emergency and they did a ct scan and could see only massive infection and could not tell where it was coming from so he was admitted and given antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy he was also very low on potassium so he was given bags of potassium and taking pills on top of that his colon was clear so it was determined his gall bladder was diseased and needed to come out but right now it was so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out so husband is now on a nonfat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotics to clear out the infection fortunately being vegan non fat is not too hard for us to do he goes in for a pre exam on wednesday and then surgery a week later but through all this i have not been doing my routing of medications and exercise and am suffering for it fibro and migraines have hit me really hard i am still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals he lost almost lbs through the last week of this whole episode in the meantime i have an appointment monday with a neurosurgeon to discuss if something needs to be done with my tethered spinal cord i have had it for years and it causes weakness in my legs and pins and needles in my feet it could also affect bladder and bowel functions but i have not had that problem yet i have read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae i am not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it was serious enough to send me to surgeons it is a rare birth defect i guess found in adults usually they catch it in infants so in a large nutshell that has been what i have been up to

0,best friend of years dropped me like nothing so i am in an ldr and my boyfriend came to visit where i live for the first time it was our second meeting so we were so happy to be together so i took him to meet my best friend who had supported me in my relationship because she had a similar situation going on after my visit with him at her house i asked if we could go over again the next night and she told me no because i third wheeled her in her own house however i do not feel we did that because we were not affectionate around her and her parents were in the room as well a little after he left i apologize to her even though i did not feel i had done anything wrong recently she has deleted me off most social media platforms and if imma be honest i do not care yes i miss having the girl companion having another girl to talk to about things but i do not want a friend that is not a true friend who just dumps years of friendship over feeling like a wheel i think there was a jealousy element to it but i will never know because i am not chasing her she is gotta come to me i am do not chasing her
0,car shopping today went well i am really looking at two cars the nissan spectra and the a saturn coupe both have the basics that i want sporty look power everything sunroof standard transmission etc the spectra has got more balls than the saturn but i think i will get a better deal with the saturn this is my first experiance buying a new car soo many choices i feel like a kid in a candy store hehe still no real resolution on the female issue seems as though it get more complicated whichever way i go so i think my plan is going to be to just ride out the storm and hope for a better days in the future i know i know not a very creative solution but i honestly cannot think of anything else on a different note i was thinking about the relationship my generation has with their work my parents worked three jobs when they were younger and to this day i have not know them to complain about it they saw it as a chance to make money and as simply doing what you needed to do it is strange that just one generation later we see people who can barely handle working one fulltime job and endlessly complain about how much they do i really believe if we worked harder as a generation we would not only do better personally but do more for each other not to get too religious but catholics believe that forgivenessredemption is not based on faith alone but also on good deeds maybe if we did more for each other on a regular basis we would all be better off then again that is just my opinion
1,i am new to the forum and this is the most interesting thread i have found so far i am in my mid fifties and have suffered from depression for as long as i can remember it is got a lot worse lately i have been an underachiever because of it but now i have slowly lost just about everything i have been on prozac effexor etc and i am now on zispin this latest one makes me sleep a lot i could not get up for work even if i could hold down a job i have gone from being a successful business man to losing wife estranging my kids and grand kids i am unemployed out of money and running out of hope it is time that depression in men was seen as the problem it really is how many of us are performing so far below what we are intellectually physically and emotionally capable of it is not just a personal problem it is a problem for our families and friends and i believe it robs our society of a lot of valuable people heres hoping that there really is a solution out there somewhere
0,my cousin long story short i have an year old cousin and i do not like him i am going on by the way my mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about i always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and i when she babysat him but i always kind of understood that she was not doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age anyways fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and i cannot stand the kid he is such a crybaby even for his age and he does not like me for some reason it started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying so i yelled at the kid and he started to cry i do not think i was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him my mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son the kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my moms ipad when he stays with us which i failed to mention is a very common occurrence i am starting to ramble but the main goal of this post was to find out if anyone feels the same way about any of their younger family members or if i am just a complete asshole

0,i am sitting here at a m wondering is it possible to fall in love with a place is it possible to want to be somewhere so much that you would forsake everything just to have a moment in that place i think that is what chicago is to me as corny as that may be i am interviewing for jobs at the moment and i cannot sleep part of me really wants the job but another part wants to fly on a whim i know what i should do but there is a great difference between what you should do and what you want to do i am so nervous right nowabout the job about the possibility of moving about everything i am literally at a time in my life when i am in serious upheaval it is a transition period and i do not like it i wish i had a crystal ball that would tell me where i will be in five years ten twenty even maybe then i would know the path that i am supposed to take but no one can tell you that can they you can only do what you feel you should and hope that it is the right decision jen
1,dead is better than alive imo i say i feel particularly sad or depressed as a constant state all over the place but i think i do want to die i choose to believe nothing after we die no afterlife no heaven or hell no reincarnation or godly ascension just a beautiful peaceful nothing and it just seems so much better than being alive when alive you feel so much yes happiness excitement surprise love but also sadness anger hate jealousy why would i chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things all the about living weigh out the bad in my head a nothingness after death just seems like the better more rational option am i wrong to think this
1,god giveth and god taketh away but lately he seems to just be taking from me i am tired of it all now a little over a year ago my grandfather who lived with us passed away about months ago my mother passed away a week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear for the time being he cannot do anything physical cannot drive and just looks like he is in pain and is talking about probably retiring meanwhile in my life i am struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a fulltime job only just a week ago i was getting ready to start to apply to fafsa in preparation for actually starting college this year now with recent developments i am not sure if that is even a viable option i will probably need to stay home and help out by getting a fulltime job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially and my brother is already in college i really do not know what i want to do or what i even can do add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down like the fact that i have no social life to speak of and honestly it is enough to make me seriously consider suicide it all just feels hopeless to me and i do not even really feel like living to see what the future holds because it feels as though it is all bleak in the long term
1,my weight is ballooning out of control i take daily mg of prozac in the morning mg klonopin same time mg klonopin pm mg klonopin bedtime prescribed by a psychiatrist i also take mg keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention prescribed by a neurologist i have been on various combinations of these for a couple of years the psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications i am on should not be making me gain weight but nonetheless they are i have had other medications that have given me side effects that i should not have had but nonetheless i do i have read many many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with ssris when i have asked him to change the medication he keeps preaching diet and exercise it has not worked i am now down to the point where i eat virtually nothing and today i exercised to the point where i nearly blacked out this is causing problems between my wife and i she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes klonopin and effexor not least because i have no sexual desire none she sees him the psychiatrist tomorrow but i do not see him until april yesterday in my therapy session i had an angry outburst that maybe i should just quit taking all the medication because maybe i am over medicated and she did not like that too much am i going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention what do i have to do to convince them this is not helping my depression any when i cannot stand to even look at myself in the mirror

1,why am i an idiot i always feel the need to be loved by someone else so i am constantly trying to talk to a girl and get a date i actually went on a date recently a couple weeks ago i hit it off with this girl from another school nearby and we had a lot in common we vibed really well and seemed to have similar feelings for each other we talked for a couple of weeks and then we went on a date i think we both enjoyed ourselves but we talk as often afterwards i blame myself for that because i feel like i should have been more social with her we talk anymore and i wish i still talked to her but it has been a weird amount of time since our date and i know how to go about it when i finally get a chance to have a girlfriend like i feel i need i fuck it up does anybody have any idea of what i can do with this situation

0,i was having a relatively average friday at work when i decided to step outside for a fresh dose of nicotine and a butt scratch as i was revelling in the sensation of my fading itch i noticed a flock of geese flying overhead inevitably the lead goose i like to refer to the leader as the big cheese was cut down by a nudist pole vaulting midget sorry small person i really like the brackets today as the two came crashing to the ground in a whirling pile of blood puss soft white bird feces i had a rather embarrasing moment of my own a horrid scent tickled my senses it was the kind of scent one does not pick up from a big cheese and a small person colliding feet in the air no this scent was a little closer to home only after i felt the squishiness between my lower cheeks did i realize what had taken place some form of monsterous human being must have stolen my pants right off my body while i was distracted by the mid air catastrophy this foul being then made doodoo in my brand new tazmanian devil boxers before carefully placing them back on my body a change of shorts and a roll of toilet paper later i began my hunt for the elusive undergarment defiling creature armed with only a plastic fork and a half burnt cigarette i patrolled the nearby streets for nearly half an hour when it hit me perhaps some of the other lower to middle class working folk in the area had been violated by the underpants bandit i went to my truck and grabbed my csi kit i ordered off the net it arrived last night just in time for me to uncover the mystery of the soiled ginch unfortunately i was unable to find any evidence outside of my own underpants there did not seem to be any eye witnesses either maybe they had been paid off or were just too afraid to talk the bandit must have got to them this journal entry was not influenced in any way by any sort of illicit substance i do not need drugs to be crazy
0,lump in breast about weeks ago i was playing on the floor with my son and noticed pain in the left part of my chest under my nipple i immediately stood up and felt the area and found what seems to be a round mass that is sensitive to the touch i went to the doctor and after insisting it be checked got her to schedule a mammogram i have hardly been able to sleep since i found it and am super nervous about my mammogram appointment tomorrow the lymph node under the left side of jaw feels super swollen i know i should just wait for the doctor but i am freaking out a bit are there any other symptoms with breast cancer in men i do not have any discharge or anything thanks in advance
1,got the news i was cancer free again last week but i feel more emptier and lonelier than ever before i am not sure what is wrong with me i know i have a great support system and i should be happy that i am far away from the crutches of painful chemo and surgeries but i just cannot fill the void inside i feel incredibly lonely and miserable i barely can rack about hours of sleep a night and at school i feel like an idiot because i can barely focus on anything anyways maybe beating cancer is not really something to be proud of i am no fucking warrior i am terrified about the whole thing the people i care about think i am brave but in all honesty i brush it off because i would rather take it again and again just so they would not i am just trying my best to take it day by day but it is getting harder and harder to deal with everything
0,again man school sucks oh well so i have like major assesment tasks this week one being super important tomorrow and its so i have like hours yet i do not know what in gods name its talking about so i am screwed and my group memebers are homo and cannot freakin answer simple questions wtf oh and i saw the other her today like we were staring at eachother she was in the car passing and i was at the bus stop and i am like that is not her cannot be wtf it is her and i did not wave haha oh well i guess i can bring it up with her at school and turn it into something swanky if it was or was not her like hey did i see you yesterday oh not you huh coz i saw this damned beautiful girl in a white and i could have sworn it was you or hey did i see you yesterday oh man i thought so but then again i thought i was seeing things and would have looked like a knob if it was not you okay so if it was not her it will work better but anyways i am screwed back to being screwed
0,best guy friend is ignoring me and i do not understand why my best guy friend jake not his real name have known each other for years we are now both years old of all the friends i currently have i have been friends with jake the longest we first met in kindergarten i used to be really chubby and shy when i was much younger so i got picked on a lot jake was my only friend back when i was in elementary school and middle school and he stood up for me a lot back then in high school i started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness lost a significant amount of weight and managed to find a small group of friends in my schools anime club throughout all this jake was a very steady loyal and supportive friend and i am forever grateful to him for that we ended up getting into different colleges both around an hour away from our hometown even though things got somewhat busy at times we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time recently i met a great guy aaron not his real name in college we started dating i wanted him to meet my friends from back home so i arranged a time to meet for dinner during our meetup i invited friends from high school including jake i noticed that jake was unusually quiet he did not say much of anything during our dinner i thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative i am usually the quieter one in our friendship so i pulled him aside and asked him what is wrong he said nothing so i figured nothing was wrong that meetup was two months ago about two weeks ago i reached out to jake on facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life he completely ignores all my messages i tried texting him to ask if he is mad at me no response i do not understand i feel completely blindsided by this because jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages a mutual friend told me that she always suspected that jake liked me but i highly doubt that he never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school he is not the shy type so i highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years
1,wrong with me i have an amazing family and an incredible group of friends the support is there and tried to help in the past but i burden them with my troubles anymore it just feels uncomfortable seen a three therapists in my life each no more than two times not sure why i just get myself to keep seeing one consistently waiting on grades from summer school but fairly positive i failed and will subsequently be kicked out of college and still have over year left to go i know where to turn i know how to move forward i sleep at night and during the day all i want to do is lay in bed my productivity is at an all time low which is saying something trust me i feel like lost it i think i hate myself

0,last night jerry douglas came to town and played a free concert that guy is so good he made me want to learn to play the dobro and the best part was that his fiddle player had a mohawk it was kind of like the whole band was saying even though we play bluegrass instruments we are way beyond bluegrass they even had the same bass player as nickel creek i wonder if that guy goes around joining bluegrass bands and then turning them into nonbluegrass bands or maybe in this case it was jerrys idea maybe he got too sick of bluegrass from playing with alison krauss well it was a really great concert nonetheless

0,well i am unsure how to start this new blogging stuff guess i will just reflect a little and see how it goes have you ever been stuck in a matrix i have to me it was like being in a padded suspended time warp during the early part of my adult life a time that lasted over years that happen to anyone and have happen to me but it did i was a new single mom no friends no job and not much family to speak of i had to make money and take care of my son i afford to live on my own so me and my child stayed with my parents i went back to school and learned a vocation then tried for years and years to make a difference be somebody and amount to something for my sons sake the matrix i was in got thicker and harder to escape from i do enough for anyone my parents my employer so called friends relatives it was like total nonacceptance i felt laughed at and demeaned like a redheaded step child i had a vision of the way i wanted my life and it happening feeling like every move i made no matter how positive only enabled those around me to throw dirt on my emotions and aspirations and even me they would throw dirt on me spreading slanderous rumor making ugly innuendo i would try and try to ignore and endure ohgaud how did i get there so much time had gone by in this continuum my ideas were lost buried in the gook and gum of this matrix intracellular structure i got really mad one day and more or less threw my hands up in despare then feeling terribly terribly angry i suddenly broke free from the matrix by desiding right then and there that i was going to make a move a move that would change my life and those that went with me for the better the anger did it i was fed up i had gotten to the point where i hated everyone around me i had to get out or die trying it took alot out of me it was a draining yet somehow refreshing experience in a way i was reborn a new beginning a time to be me and a very liberating change i had escaped it was my independance day

0,through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed power or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable from the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it is always one of those things so you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything my point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary i cannot stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views that is like telling me i should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit on them and like it do you have to agree with me hell no do i have to agree with you hell no what if we just cannot come to an agreement then it is time for a fight i do have to tell you something while you were picking daisys and doing drugs and watching tv i was working out eating right and learning how to fight so when the shit hits the fan and conflict is inevitable who is side would you rather be on

1,why is it so hard to just be empathetic today i failed miserably at baking a key lime pie filling was way too loose meringue would not whip crust cracked just a terrible time overall and then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do says better luck next time with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth i got even more upset and that seemed to genuinely confuse her all i wanted in that moment was for her to say i am sorry your pie did not turn out it will be okay or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter this even just kind of exemplified what i get sick of in people even if you do not get it why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses it can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days if we share an achievement or more rarely a failure with you be with us in that emotion for a moment why is that so hard for normal people oh yeah because all the empathetic people are depressed
1,get myself to be more activealive so my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years i am in law school and i am in the last year of preparation in our country this is the busiest time ever for those students like they start studying at in the morning at stay until in the night at the library nonstop studying for years in preparation for the big exams i started last october it is july i have maybe studied on two or three days seriously the other time i just sit at home in a kind of weird freeze i am bored out of my mind my brain is longing for some activity and i actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like i have a purpose it is like i know exactly how important it is now and my brain is screaming at me to get my books out and start doing what i want to do but i just sit here heck if i am procrastinating so bad at least i could have fun party travel meet people see the world at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that is at least fun but i am still sitting here like in a shock it feels like it is too late for the studying thing exams are in spring and i have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes i am paying for and i have no idea what else to do with my time it does not help that over the last two years i kind of developed an eating disorder with anorexic bulimic and bingeeatingtendencies that also made my health decline i am constantly thinking about numbers looking up nutritional infos reading medical studies looking at food online it is taking so much space in my head although i am quite close to my goal and i should not even worry because if i keep doing what i planned restrict for another weeks then slowly up my calories until i no longer lose weight stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy eating healthy and exercising to maintain good health there is no reason to be so occupied with this topic any idea how to get myself to get up and do something the sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed because i watch my life burn down and kind of cannot do anything about please do not suggest to get professional help i know it is the most rational thing especially for the eating thing but right now i just cannot i really cannot
1,carpe diem today is the day for change i am sick and tire of letting my depression get in the way all the time i am sick of being shy secluded and uninterested i am sick of letting my depression define me at this very moment nothing but suicidal and depressing thoughts envelop my mind its taking every fiber of my being to not load my gun and just end it i do not want to solve my problems like that today is the day i have renewed my gym membership i am going back to work soon i am making it a goal to quit smoking and excessively drinking to coap with my depression hell i have even make it a goal to stop watching pornography and masterbating for the next days i am getting off of my zoloft and i am going to do my best to turn my life around i have let my depression ruin so many friendships and relationships with loved ones i do not want to beat myself up anymore i do not want to use my depression and a means to try and emotionally connect with someone i am tired of using it as an excuse for everything i am tired of loosing people because i refuse or just do not know how to be happy i want to actually live again i want to enjoy life not let it pass me by i want to change
1,nothing i just do not want to do anything nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore the stuff i study in school is really cool but when i get home i just want to lay down and do nothing smoking weed makes it easier but i know i am just pushing my feelings away i am just tired and i feel like a bitch because of it i go to school work on some homework go to work procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time rinse repeat i wish i could stop working and just focus on school cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as i can dedicate the time to it but after working i just want to do nothing and if i work less hours i just get stressed about paying rent i do not know if i hate myself or this economy more but i just wish i could go far away sometimes just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing listen to a waterfall crash in the forest or just look up at a sky that is not polluted to hell with light i have been so good lately been through this long enough i know why i am like this it is february and february always sucks
1,people making a mockery of depression makes me more depressed they treat it like its a fairytale people take it too light i do not want to open up anymore to people i rather bottle it up and have my weekly breakdowns
1,advice for making it through school in my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and i lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function i do any schoolwork without panicking and crying because i think i could do it i was scared of everything during finals my cat died and i just sorta gave up i failed everything and took a year off my family was so disappointed and treated me so differently for the year that i was out about a month and a half before the fall semester of i got on a new medication and decided to felt good enough to go back to school i knew i had no other option anyway i did surprisingly well that semester but now that break is over finding myself just as terrified as i was that semester i failed i know what happened and i know how to get back to functioning again i drop out again why do i feel so low after having such a strong start i really thought things were getting better but i feel like being taken over by this again if anyone else has any advice for getting through it and regaining faith in myself love to hear it
1,why do i feel like i do not know myself anymore i keep struggling with depression and i feel like it is stripping away all the things that make me me i used to be a good student used to write stories about adventure and life used to play sports used to enjoy hanging out with friends and now i am nothing i have been losing parts of myself until all that is left of me is misery all i feel like doing anymore is laying in my bed and staring at the ceiling or if i am feeling particularly bad i cut myself what happened to me i try to be hopeful but that gets exhausting
1,i should be on antidepressants but do not want to negative emotions prevent me from thinking correctly or consistently it so hard to keep things in the right perspective i get angery and scared i will have a heart attack during a bout of it sometimes i act insane just because of how inconsequential or meaningless it is which is not the right way to act i do not know why i do not try to think positively or if i can i think i should really quit my job but it would be the wrong decision in the long run maybe
1,what is happening i just felt the weirdest mix of emotions i was normal but then i started tearing up and breathing really hard i began to cry but i was smiling my body went numb and i held my hands up to my face i continued to cry and laugh at the same time i pulled at my hair it is over now i still feel numb

1,is it obvious when you have depression i wonder if i have some form of mild depression or i just have low self esteem i became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down i think it may have been catatonia but i am not ever since then i do not feel like i got back to my normal self i am a lot shyer and i do not have much luck socially or romantically or in my career the best way to put it would be i lost my personality i can really beat myself up sometimes because i hate myself when something bad happens i really start self loathing quite badly i do not feel suicidal i hate myself more than i hate my life i blame my lack of success on myself i do not enjoy things as much as i used to so i have no real hobbies i do not think i am likable and i cannot even pass interviews these days i lost my personality and that is why i hate myself i am unrecognisable to who i used to be so i isolate myself a lot more these days i do not think significantly depressed but i wonder if mild depression is the because of my loss of personality or could it be something else that caused me to change all i know is i have lost a lot of confidence and i am always beating myself up about it
0,it is monday once again after a short break over the weekend its funny how time flies nowadays and how you can never get things done no matter how much effort or planning you have put into them august is one month that i feelthe days and nights went by in a flash was in the car on the way to work earlier and there was this one kancil which was following me so close from behind the unbelieavable thing is that i was doing and so how much was the chap doing by the look on his face and the passenger sitting right next to him i could tell that he is a student studying in the college somewhere near my office or maybe he is a working guy but they looked young and were pretty excitedbeing able to hog me like that i gave way and they went so fast that for a few moments there i was praying that their tyre would go flat because they were not worried at all about their safety do they know that it is kancil they are driving not a bloody mercedes and even if it is a mercedes it is dangerous still for a year old kiddie to drive in such a way i am not old but i am not a teenager anymore i have been there and done that but i did not interfere with anybodys life during that time and i did it with full consideration in mind that i would bear all the consequences alone on my own of course parents are parents and they would always worry about things that you cannot stop them it is a natural instinct embedded in parents a speacial gift from god if not moms would be walking around leaving their kids and home and shop at malls why bother about baby cemara no she will be fine she can drink her milk from the bottle by herself she can suckle later we all do not what that trust me so kids or teenagers like those i came across this morning they are not really bad they are just at that age where they rule everything hope one of them will turn out to be a successful someone if not all got to work on something will continue later

1,i feel like i done a good enough job of enjoying my childhood as someone who recently turned i feel like started the next part of my life and given my childhood a finite end i wish i like that but i just feel less and less connected to the kid i was as every day passes the worst is that i feel like i missed the best part of my life and wasted my one shot to enjoy it as much as i could idk i really just want to hear from actual adults who have gone through something similar and know how to keep in touch with their child side red heart selector
1,i am new to this so please bear with me i do not even know where to begin with all of the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war i feel i have no right to be unhappy but i am i am years old and have made a complete mess of my life my parents were raised in europe and came to the states in their i have a younger brother who also has depression but it differs from my own when i look back at my childhood all i feel is pain and neglect and i cannot recall any happy memories i do not believe that i was ever physically abused however i do think that i was ignored and emotionally neglected perhaps that is why i manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going well i am married and have a year old son from all outward appearances my life comes across as perfect although we all know there is no such thing i have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since i was and have tried to commit suicide on four separate occasions my mother suffers from depression and her mother did as well this is such a long and complicated story and i do not know how much i am allowed to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat room my interior pain lies so far deep that i do not sleep hardly eat and feel miserable all the time i guess that is all i will say for now
0,okay so maybe this thing is the new livejournal bandwagon who knows do not really care at this point i am far too lazy to maintain my own blog atm so this is going to work just fine for me i find myself wondering why i persist in this constant struggle with my shape it seems like no matter how much i cut back or how much i exercise i do not change all that much i am supposed to hit the dr in weeks to have her tell me i am too fat thrilling eh also we have shifting managerial garbage over at work and that has me stressed out i want assistant manager really badly i do not know if it will ever happen at this point i am afraid to transfer over to the other store i am offered right now because of a few things one the store itself is a nightmare everyone steals employees customers you name it two it is huge more work i feel like i bust my ass as it is the story i hear about the new place is that no matter what happens no matter what you do it always gets undone no matter how fast you come in next shift and it is a warzone three the drive time i do not want to commute again i like having my minutes to and from now it is a good thing to transfer bigger store more money and more hours but that does not mean that it will compensate for the amount of time taken from my day or the cash guzzling cars gas tank i will be paying out the nose for the largest deterrant however is the fact that i will have to close during the week i do not want to closings a pain in the ass sure it is the easier of the two shifts but hey i do not like being up that late and not having anything to do when you get home because it is too late to watch a movie and you are too wound up to sleep the only plus to that is that most likely i would no longer have to do inventory shifts at any rate i decided not to take it i just have to call the boss and tell her tomorrow i want it but they would have to at least give me a raise just to have me do it that is what my times going to cost them if they want me down there that badly which they will not heh

0,it was a cold kind of day the kind of cold kind of day that makes you chilly if you happen to be out side without warm clothes on that is how cold it was and it just so happens that a character in this story happened to be out side on this cold day without any warm clothes on in fact he was not wearing any clothes at all for that reason and other reasons too it was imperative that he find shelter immediately or soon there after he had never experienced a day like this before ever before never in his lifetime before he hopes to never experience anything like this again but is what he hopes for really what is best for him only time will tell this is the story of a man of a boy of a legend that no has heard of of a hero that no one knows it will make you laugh it will make you cry you will read it from start to finish you will not be able to put it down you just wait you will think you are just reading a book you should know better you will soon realize the book is reading you he was running through the snow like a blind man all he could see was white endless white everywhere he turned everywhere he fell no matter where he looked all there was was white the poor boy he went flying as he tripped over a particularly bumpy patch of white over the cliff he went into the void he fell for what seemed like only seconds but really days passed as he fell what could he do though besides fall well really quite a lot but how was he to know if he had read the instructional manual before he took the plunge he would have known that in order to stop falling all he had to do was simply to stop

0,i am getting annoyed constantly by one of my closest friends we have been friends since grade and she is a great friend outgoing funny smart the usual we are pretty close not absolute besties but at the level where we can share memes with each other at and not think it weird but this year she is the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me so i sit with her everyday the problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch so i am always the awkward third wheel i always try to help her when she needs it because a she is my friend and b she does not have an easy home life she never has enough to eat at lunch so i always bring something extra and she also always needs rides everywhere she says it is because her guardian is at work or is visiting other family is babysitting but i think her family just does not want to give her rides places i do not mind most of the time but it is gotten to the point where she almost assumes we will give her a ride when she needs it and we cannot always do that she also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room and i never even see her until orchestra class i know somethings not right but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded i have made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra and they have the same lunch i do i went and sat with them one day but my other friend looked almost mad when i told her i was sitting with them just for that day it is okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when i ask where you have been but i cannot make new friends and sit with them every now and then i am just not sure where to go from here because i do not want to stop being friends i really do not but i just feel like my new friends can be better friends and friends i can relate to better i just do not want to do or say something i will regret especially because i know her life at home is not great and she needs friends but she should not be pushing her problems onto me either

1,i have suffered from depression episodes for about years lately due to major stresses at work i am back into feeling awful i am a good employee and have hidden my depression episodes well in the past but now i am terrified that my new boss whom i hate will find out and fire me i am working double time to not be seen as weak and incompetent i cannot afford to get fired but am terrified that that my boss will use anything to get me fired the stress of trying to be professional at all times at my job is just about killing me it makes me so angry when other employees have physical illness such as cancer or heart problems my employer rallies around them and makes all sorts of accommodations but i have kept my depression a secret because i am afraid it will be seen as a character flaw and i will be fired plus i am so paranoid i am sure when i come into work each day i will be escorted off the premises and i do not know what i will do any advice from those of you who have been terrified of being discovered

1,all of my friends annoy me i try to hang out with because i know meant to be good for me probably about people close to these are all good people who known for years who i can be honest with about my emotions and mental health who genuinely do care about me on paper amazing and they are only i find that whenever i spend time with a friend they end up annoying the shit out of me each one for a different reason one talks about herself too much one is too positive and gushy one only ever talks about the past the other only wants to hang out and drink when with them i just find myself wishing i could be alone i know the problem is with me and that sabotaging my relationships as i always do and have done for many years i feel guilty about it especially knowing that lucky to even have friends but the truth is i find people exhausting and whenever with them i just feel lonelier that when alone i end up getting snappy like watching myself destroy my relationships but i know how to stop hanging out with people makes me unhappy beginning to think i should become a hermit out in the woods on my own i know why i posted this i suppose i just want to tell somebody

1,i was wondering what peoples viewpoints are on for being on medication because it seems like getting the right combo of medications seem tricky and if you do not get the right combination you still remained depressed or worse than before i am curious to know what the myths vs non myths about antidepressants antipsychotics mood stabilizers etc do they make you feel worse they say that the medications generally make you feel more like yourself than different but it takes some months to get attuned to them is that correct i have been trying to fight off my depression for over years i think it is a factor from childhood abuse in recent years perhaps my nerves have grown thin and i am slowly wearing myself out my friends have recommended more therapy since i see a school counselor once every two weeks but it is difficult to really focus on my emotion health when i know that i will be relocated in two months and i feel that my current emotional stability is just shaky is it advisable to start medications without therapy and then when i relocate to wherever i find a job then begin therapy there in other words i have never been on medications before any advice would be helpful
0,i have never been good at keeping a diary so this may not work out so well today after work i had a surprise in that jeff had called and left me a message on my cell phone i was very skeptical of ever hearing from him again i still do not know what happened over graduation weekend to because the complete lack of communication between us recently i guess at some level i knew that we would never be able to work things out with miles between us i was dreaming for a little bit i do believe things happen for a reason however i just wish i could figure out the reason for having met james at this time in my life it is almost scary how perfect he is for me we have the same stupid sense of humor and understand each other perfectly i cannot imagine him ever being an asshole or us ever staying mad at each other why does he have to move to texas in weeks long distance just is not my thing so once again i will get my heart broken and recover only to move on and get it broken again which i guess is the way i prefer it i am too young to settle down with one man i just wish i would quit meeting these incredible guys at such wrong times when am i going to get a break in love on the good side i had a fabulous weekend i am beginning to love my new home here the possibilities are endless in this area i am making friends and figuring my way around work is good much better than i had thought it could be i guess i am a true geek at heart who would have known i still do not think i could live here for the rest of my life though and be happy i think this is a great stepping stone though for or years then it will be off to bigger and better things for me maybe i will move back home or maybe to texas who knows i love that i have so many choices in my life i really do feel very fortunate to have had all the opportunities in my life that have happened lately life is good

1,finally got a job but do not really care so finally after about months i got a job the job is not a bad one quite the opposite actually they specifically hired me saying that they were not looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep themtrain them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well i take it i said yes though mostly out of seizing a good opportunity i am not happy or excited i just do not care really ampnbsp first and foremost i am a minimalist the urgency of i need to save and buy a house or i need a secure caree etc is nonexistent in my life everything i own could fit in a van and there would still be space left i am not exaggerating i have even contemplated living in one build some insulation to the walls lay out some flooring and call it home i would be absolutely comfortable anyway my point is i actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity the only thing that really ran through my head was i will probably kick myself in the ass in the future for not taking this considering this is a job thatll eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time and requires no degrees or fancy stuff it was kind of hard to say no but it was also kind of hard to say yes i do not have an endgame i do not have a goal at best the closest thing to a goal that came to mind was eh i would probably get back into riding and buy myself a motorcycle or something that was it my mind literally blanks after that nothing else is there ampnbsp i am not suicidal i do not go to sleep hoping that i will never wake up again though i would not be upset by it and i do not wake up upset that i am alive for another day in life if i had to describe how i feel right now everything is in a very very quiet limbo it is a very passive depression ampnbsp the best way i can summarize it is that this world has so much noise and it is exhausting for me i get exhausted just from thinking about it i wish people could just relax and stop stirring so much motion around it is always been like this for my entire life i am so tired everythingeveryone has to move around with such haste but all i want to do is stop i just want to appreciate the colors i want to laugh i want to be happy but in this world you cannot be happy looking at the colors ampnbsp you just cannot
1,i really need someone to listen this is a throwaway because i do not want anyone in my personal life to see this let me preface this by saying i have been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies i guess you cannot diagnose bipolar disorder until you are severe depression chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia i have been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago and i have struggled with self harm since fourth grade i was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school thankfully i have been clean for a year and after the hospital i got on medication and things started to get better for a while my senior year has been great so far but it is starting to get bad again i used to be a social smoker but now i am completely dependent on marijuana for everything i am not hungry unless i smoke and i cannot fall asleep unless i smoke i need it to get through the day i cannot go to college because i cannot afford it and my mom says she cannot consign on a loan for me i totally understand that too because if my dad were to die she would be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt i am just sad because i want to go away like all of my friends but i cannot my dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too which is going to put us in poverty my mom and dad fight all the time and hate each other they have both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively i pretend like it does not bother me but it does my dad is addicted to prescription painkillers and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home he comes to my choir concerts plays and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts which hurts me a lot i pretend like i do not care about that either the thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today she was my first dog i was allergic to dogs when i was way younger i grew out of it and it took so long to find her because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us we found her and now she is gone i was the one who stayed in the room with her because my mom could not do it i pet and comforted her while she died i have never had to cope with someone dying before and it is so hard she was just a dog but i still loved her so much i want her back so bad my problems are so minor compared to some peoples but i am so sad right now i do not know what to do this is the first time in a while that i have wanted to kill myself but i do not want to go down that road again i just do not know how to cope anymore

1,debunking everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response stigmatising people with mental health more stigmatising telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry and bad genes psychiatristspsychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions only drug or involuntarily people telling people they overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as due to and subjugating the from the subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide all for the progress of telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like and never really live a normal life yet the stigmatisers the one who solicitates a lawyer when you have tried a psychiatric drug that almost made you kill yourself now you want to fight psychiatry but okay with kids being chemically lobotomised on ritalin how many more expansions of diagnosis in the dsm does it have to be to wake you sheeples up that collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of with symtomps does it have to be to tell you that these behaviours found through cellular pathology brain scans blood tests or some medical diagnostic criteria how many more deaths school shootings senseless violence suicide by the administration of drugs will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry has killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the jewish halocaust time to wake up and see that the of mental is just psychiatric propaganda to deflect all the damage and runid by their tortuous domain and authoritarian political reign wearing a badge upon your head saying is self deprecative as surrended your mental factilites and human experienceemotion for the nimh admitted you define and want to use you as some priori for the campaigns to sell treatment therapy and drugs own titles like beat i not resigning yourself to a pathetic existence of numbing your emotions and dying years younger on psychiatric drugs

0,i cannot believe how hung over i feel today yet not an ounce of booze has touched these lips i think that it was the coming off of travel and the lack of sleep it almost makes me giggle that this same feeling of apathy stomach turning and headache can be caused by something other than beer it is also an emotional hang over of sorts i suppose it is the factor that i was just feeling so much yesterday but i did not want to feel at least not on the inside i miss sensory feeling i think that i have closed myself off so much from the world that i have protected myself both emotionaly and physicaly i think that the phyiscal ramifications come first it is much easier to lie to your head than to your physical self i truly do not really know what i am talking about but it seemed to make sense at the moment

1,first of all a happy christmas to one and all my situation is that i have had moderate depression on and off since years old and years ago aged i had it so bad i had to be off work for months then i tried the ssri escitalopram and it worked perfectly and i went back to work i came off it a year ago and then months ago i suffered a relapse and had to go back on it and now i am ok except when it came back for days after a booze bender my psychiatrist is saying i should take them indefinitely as i have no side effects i am happy with this but i am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years is this right and if so would not it be better to ration them so i only take them after i relapse so they keep on working for longer if not the rest of my life is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason and now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication yes i have heard that you can switch to others but surely the same type of reasoning applies the psychiatrist said that i had endogenous depression with a reactive because and that she did not think that counseling would help does this make sense a former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting weird well apart from posting on an internet forum i do not think i have done anything weird and other friends agree with me but other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these happy pills for a long term that antidepressants are a short term fix only but what do they know you cannot really tell if others have depression from the outside neil years young from the uk
1,i do not know what i am living for i honestly do not know why i keep living another day i have no one to love me my very friends are dick heads my parents do not care how i am feeling and when they do they just throw a bible verse at my face acting as if talking to some sky man is going to cure me i have yet to even hug a girl in my life probably because i am such an ugly awkward beta shit i have no plans for my future i am overall retarded in school all i can do is be an escapist by playing video games watching videos eating unhealthy food and all i do is isolate myself from reality my therapist is overall useless all she does is repeat the same shit i hear from people i honestly do not comprehend why i will not just end it all

1,when staring at the blank wall is no longer boring does anyone else find themselves just staring at something lost in endless thought
0,i cannot figure out why some people only give out their opinions only to destroy someone else what is wrong with people today i am sick and tired of hearing views and beliefs on politics religion and other stuff i am sick of seeing the way people behave when it comes to opposing views why cannot we just i do not know sit and enjoy the fresh air on a spring day sounds corny i know but is not that better than bashing a man for what he thinks is right or wrong what did jesus do he ate with people that were wrong and people who reveled in their own beliefs he loved them he did not care i am so sick of us so called christians seeking out only people who disagree with us only to prove that we are right what worth is that will the glory of the coming lord be enough for them and us i guess not because all we care about is making sure that we are right and that they are wrong why cannot we enjoy life loving people enjoying that we are different and loving them to christ not proving it to them life is so short how can we make it count if we do not live by example and live with him when i go out in the world i will try hard not to condemn people but love them and in the meantime sit and enjoy the day instead of sinking in my own socalled righteousness god did not create man to argue but to love and prosper with him and by the way if you are going to talk with people who do not agree with you remember this the greatest single because of atheism in the world today is christians who acknowledge him with their lips and walk out the door and lead on with their lifestyle that is what i am believing the world simply finds unbelievable
0,help relationship with my depressed mentally messed up friend this is my first time posting on reddit sorry if i have made any mistakes this post is going to be quite long to start with my friend and i are both year olds living in hong kong and we study in the same school she is a great person very special someone i can never forget the problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed and i feel like i will just make things worse because of her laughs and nearcrazy actions nobody knows her true feelings in fact she constantly complains about everything being unpopular being immature the education system here her online friends just to mention a few she is tired and feels like a loser all the time games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality i do not mind listening to rants it is ok to be sad but i seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide during lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply a typical example of our conversation why am i so unpopular why am i so unpopular maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people then she starts to regret her choices why did she choose to study in this school if she had been in another school she would have been happier etc in her letters she questioned about the meaning of life she wrote about nightmares thought crimes and leaving the endless circle of life that left me terrified all i could do is to sit next to her speechless if i said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions i can never give an answer simply because i do not know how i once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend her advice was literally trash and i ended up crying when i talked about her suicidal thoughts i have no idea what to do the next day when you see her at the school gates she puts on that smile again but she definitely has problems anyone has experience in dealing with such friends depressed friends who smiles all the time it sounds weird to ask what i can do for you because she normally will not respond at least i think so what should i or should not say to her

0,trying to make me jealous i once asked some friends about where they get one of their items and they both seemed to shrug it off laugh and basically show that they do not want me to know i thought wow ok did not expect it from friends but i guess some people are petty about some things and they knew that it got to me a little that they did not tell me but whatever now they would bring up the topic of this item here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it i have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their dominant position they probably get a kick out of it the problem is i do not know the best way to react to it when it is brought up in convo to show that i am not envious or jealous and i am not jealous of it at all as i actually found out what i needed to through other means it just bugs me that they think it does and so i do not want to give off that vibe so they can go into a private convo and laugh about it

1,my formative years were spent in small towns until the third grade i lived in indiana from the third grade through my junior year in high school i lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern michigan you could walk or ride your bike to anywhere down to the lake out on country roads wherever my father was a lutheran school teacher principal and church organist from time to time he would take a call to serve in another lutheran school in a different town in the summer of right after my junior year in high school he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of st louis it was quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small insular towns all her life to move to a city the size of st louis quite honestly when we arrived here i absolutely hated it i felt as if i had been thrown to the dark side of the moon i had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment everyone else already had their group or circle of friends going back at least three years now you had to have a lot more guts and fortitude and selfesteem than i had at the time to break into already established groups and make new friends this was the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life this was the year of my first therapist the first of many to come the start of a lifetime of selfdiscovery

0,so first and foremost i have to give credit to nichole who brought me up to and introduced me to this whole blog thing i have a feeling i am going to become an addict so i signed up for this and they asked me to fill out a profile and then proceeded to cut and paste whatever they wanted out of it example i wrote a whole paragraph about how i was so happy that they made the question name your favorite books because usually it just asks for one but then proceeds to ask for your favorite tv shows i capitalize the s because they want it to be plural as if you should be watching more tv and reading less i guess it is easier and most people filling out these surveys are not interested in writing for hours about their favorite reads but instead about what happened last night in nick and jessica actually i could tell you because secretly kate and i watch it and then wonder what it would be like if mtv came and filmed us i shall leaving wanting more only because my point of this is i am being censored in the wrong way you see i promote reading and educating yourself you know seeking the truth finding your own path and they cut that shit out what the fk oh i just realized this is correct oh my bad this is the new interpretation of the first ammendment sorry thanks for the correction i forgot we are all suppose to be getting our news from fox and nevermind the independent thinking it wears on the brain let someone else do it for you okay nevermind just disregard what i just wrote and recommence status quo so already i love this blog thing except i do not think anyone is going to read it but it is okay i already feel better it is like free therapy i mean someone may read it and laugh or think oh this poor girl how pathetic but whatever i can write about all my shit and if kate wants to catch up on what i am thinking because she always says i do not know what you are thinking she can log on and read instead of strong arming me into watching nick and jessica
1,i have such a strong urge to just pick my stuff and leave at the moment that it is not even funny i really really just want to grab a bus ticket and get out of here i suppose there are a lot of reasons but one in particular this is going to get a little creepy and it involves incest so please do not read any further if you are just going to flame me my brother has an attraction to me which really creeps me out he is all the time running around the house naked hitting on me helping me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest it really really disturbs me my problem is that he asked me if it was all right if he hung around naked and stuff when i was drunk i told him yes because i did not have my mind about me now i cannot think of how to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and that i do not want him doing it anymore along with that i just lost my best friend due to depression i have been trapped in my house for two weeks and i have not seen my mom dad brother or sister for more than five minutes in this entire time i just want to run away from it all i do not want to kill myself but i do want to pack and go and just get away from this wretched town would it be such a bad thing to leave i know it would be running from my problems but maybe i could find easier problems to deal with somewhere else

0,alright i just browsed through a ton of blogs i am procrastinating working on my thesis but it is so damn boring anyway people put the stupidest stuff on their blogs if you want random people to read about your life do not post inside jokes blogs should be about your life or at least something worthwhile saying a bunch of random quick words that only your friends understand should be saved for your damn i am away messages your mindless blogs are getting in the way of people seeing mine and mine am not worthless mine are cool they are not about i went to the store and bought some flipflops but about crazy weird stories that happen to me at the mental hospital or about how i visited bob jones university times in high school or about how i had to wear skirts below the middle of my knees to school before they came into style or about how i got kicked out of my christian high school for having cigarettes in my car i was not even smoking them or about how after this happened i tried to commit suicide that was long ago i am doing fine now but thanks for asking and while i was in the hospital being injected with crazy stuff that would make me crap and vomit until i could hardly breathe or swallow my godfearing compassionate high school principal was telling my parents how i was expelled well at any rate i will not bore you with worthless inside jokes hell if you bother to read my blog you will be the better for it you know why cuz i have got alot of really weird stories
0,after much encouragement from my techsavvy boyfriend decided to get on board with the concept of blogging as a writer it only makes sense that i find an outlet to document my thoughts however i still kind of feel like doogie houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe remember how he would always pause right before the last few words that lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience and then he would always type the last couple of words really slowly i guess that was a primitive form of blogging i still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing i mean why would anyone care what i had for breakfast or thought of a movie i had recently seen i guess just like having a diary but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it regardless i feel that writing for leisure again instead of just for work will be a positive experience for me
1,when people say do not quit ssris listen to them i was put on lexapro through my universitys health center but summer rolled around and since i was not taking a physical class online ones do not qualify you for student insurance apparently i had to pay for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions i thought i was in a good enough place not financially though obviously that i did not even need lexapro anymore so i started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day i went from about to a day for a week or two and then i ran out fast forward to today several weeks without and i feel like i am having a mental breakdown over every single thing i am a year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases i was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and i ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair this is all very interesting considering i got on this and xanax because i could not even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown another instance is when i stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge do not fucking quit cold turkey i thought i could handle it but i definitely cannot i just hope this ends soon i honestly feel like i am losing it entirely

0,drug addict friend i have had this best friend for over years now we were childhood friends and basically grew up together the past years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school later on he started to dabble into drugs and the once he started doing that i kind of distanced myself because i know how to react i was kind of mad but also sad so i really talk to him as much fast forward to now i talk to him more but i know if it will ever be the same he is always talking about trying new drugs and doing all this stuff at parties which tbh i really care for should i still attempt to have that relationship we once had i still care for him but so hard to listen and be there for him when putting himself in dangerous situations if i stop being friends with him does that make me a bad friend for not sticking through it should i stay friends to try and make a positive environment help

0,you want to know why this girl looks how she looks well this poor little girl was forced by me to talk with me for more than an hour hmm you wonder why i did this well let us start with the background since simon a class mate of mine invited us to a grill party this became a tradition the photo was taken at such a party and me being very drunk started to talk to every girl telling her such great things like you are the horniest in our gradates or you can run but i will always find you well for this not being embarassing enough i looked for a victim i can talk to for longer time well there she was this time i was in love with a chubby cheeked girl named karen luckily my conversation partner was the best friend of her so the conversation was only about how karen and i match together you can imagine that me being very drunk said things which i had better not said finally i can only say that i do not remember all the stuff i told her but my opinion about relationships and what is important in such relationships were the best things i told her because now everybody knows what a horny guy i am with my years well this evening seemed to be a turning point of my imagination for a relationship with karen because later she wanted to clear some things between me and her this resulted in a telephone conversation for about nearly two hours the only thing i can conclude from this session is that she is an ecological cunt who thinks that she is something better than others one reason which let us me conclude so is that a friend of her told me that goodnaturedness was the only reason why she talked to me well i did not knew that every person who talks to me is just good natured i do not think that conversation is a thing of goodnaturedness because if so the world will get egoistically and it will become a privilege to talk to someone else sorry but here it seems that sombebody stayed too long in the broad sunlight maybe she planted too many patches which is what she does right at the moment d this is it for now i hope you enjoyed reading this and i hope i could give you a small view of my life greetz

0,conservative republican parents amp liberal arts educated democrat child what could go wrong i grew up in a poor household but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college after graduating from school and coming back home i realized that i have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore they do not understand the concept of privilege think everyone on welfare is lazy voted for trump and defend him and every time i get legitimately pissed off at them they say that the school i went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort i had to put in not only to get into this school but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a gpa i was a sociology major too so these issues are literally what i spent most of my four years studying it is now at the point where i cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up it gets worse by the issue and the worst part is that they are decent and loving people is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation what do you do i am slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point and moving out is the obvious solution but i do not just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like i do not pay rent

1,i should be an actor i feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies i do not know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it is hard to breathe but recently i have been having to act like i am getting better from depression my roommate confided in me one day when i came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression he was placed in a foster home after his parents died and his foster mom committed suicide after that his friend also committed suicide so of course this takes a toll on someones emotional health i told him that i started taking meds and going to therapy and i smile and laugh and act like i am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression i feel so fake though even though i am getting help i do not think it is helping me my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do i feel like crying a lot of the times now while i am laying down in bed and driving to and from class i would never let my roommate know that i was actually not doing better though i really want him to get help because i see myself in him and he is a really good person who does not deserve to be sad i wish depression never existed it is such a sick disease

0,today i got my orange belt in choi kwang do the last light colored belt before green which goes into the darker colored belts i took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wifes fuji sharp camera since i am an asst instructor i am now teting every month i have my patterns down through green belt and plan on learning blue and purple patterns this week this weekend i did my first nonofficial videography event a reception party for a couple that was married in hawaii several months ago luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event i took about hours of film i would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual events that you have to capture this was basically just a party and therefore i became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that i had to walk around taping interesting converstaions luckily the bride groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends my wife was the photographer so in some cases i followed her around but as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent i was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees though i was really wanting grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped must be a generational thing have you ever had a mental image of someone you worked with over long distances but then when you actually met them or saw their picture realized your image was way off base had that happen today man talk about being wrong anyway i am off to play xbox later
0,last sunday i completed my first long run miles not bad i followed the suggested training regimen this week even the friday crosstraining session my packet of training info suggested that was down the best crosstraining activity for i decided since i bought a swimsuit last fall i would put it to good use at yales olympicsized pool the only person in the area who did not think i was a complete idiot was the undergraduate student lifeguard whom i informed of my intent to he was a member of the yale swim team and familiar with pool running he proceeded to describe types of pool running exercises and while trying to explain one in particular asked me if i was familiar with water polo i replied but i know how to play marco polo unfortunately my childhood days of marco polo training proved insufficient referring to pool running the article states that it looks a little odd well they were right all or so people at the pool including the children trying to play around in the lane next to me thought i was a complete whackjob to give you a better idea of what pool running looks like think of a common dream you might have had or heard of you know the one where someone is chasing you and you are running but not going anywhere it is like that but add to your mental picture lanes of professional swimmers lane of kids trying not to stare a swim cap goggles and melissa bourgeois trying to to the other end of the pool without drowning that is pool running although i looked like a total ass in the pool i felt great afterwards much unlike i feel today it seems i have either mild food poisoning or a stomach virus either way i cannot even think of food without wanting to vomit suffice it to say i will not make my mile long run today which i am very disappointed about it is only going to make my miler next week that much harder i am trying to get as much rest as possible today so i can try to make up the long run tomorrow we will see right now i am going to head for the couch and a little comedy central

0,scared and alone hello everyone little background i am a year old mom of small boys no immediate family history of breast cancer i found a lump in my right breast sometime in mid april but it was close to my period so i left it alone fast forward to the week after my cycle and it was still there so i made an appointment with my obgyn to see what he thought this morning was the appointment he told me it was nothing to worry about but then asked if he could remove the fluid with a needle to check the color well i said yes and no fluid came out just little pieces of tissue that he put on a slide he punctured it several times so reading up i am seeing that cysts are fluid filled and tumors are not i am just super worried too because he said if it was a cyst that it would go away with the aspiration and the lump is still there any advice would be appreciated
1,had one of those days where i really wanted to just get out of bed and be with people hit up my friends and no one could hang out or seemed into it really brought me down man i feel like i give a lot and do not get a whole lot in return sometimes and part of this is probably just egocentrism i should not expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute even though i told them i was feeling lonely it just sucks because i feel like i would do anything for the people i care about like i would drop anything to be there i put those standards on other people and maybe that is wrong of me anyway i just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is
1,lately i have been having some very vivid story like dreams normally i cannot follow my dreams because they switch too quickly i had a dream where i took my grandmothers large knife and a permanent marker and wrote my signature on it then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done that she made me cry and i actually woke up crying then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by tom cruise who had gained a lot of weight and when things began to heat up i rejected him and he became very angry at me he then later came to the house where i was and began trying to hurt me and the people around me which was an older lady a young boy and teenage girl i could hear him saying just kill them and talking about how he was really embarrassed when i rejected him and he could do so much better than me i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt tom defensively but in a very graphic manor i cannot understand why i am having such negative dreams why they are so vivid and what they all mean

1,how much longer can i fake it i am had a fulltime job for several years and have a young son i took a leave from work in for mental illness at which point i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder prescribed zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out this was the first time i had been on antidepressants i felt tired all the time had no sex drive and started gaining weight but at least i was functional over the next year i received a few verbal warnings and written warning at work about my poor performance eventually the mask broke and i was on leave again in this time i was away for much longer was diagnosed w dysthymia tried several different medications found out that just about every ssri gave me horrible side effects sweating nausea insomnia no sex drive i am actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome and eventually landed on remeron and wellbutrin this combo actually started to work without any side effects except for weight gain which i have been managing with a diet now this time i returned to work because i received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on years without being at work i figured if i was going to be fired for not returning i may as well return make some money and worst thing that happens is i get fired anyways i was not better when i returned to work i was functional i was able to smile but the low mood persisted in a big way and so here i am still working trying to fake it everyday feeling like a house of cards that is ready to topple i am afraid because if i go off work again that will have been leaves of absence and i really do not think i could show my face around here anymore after that i remember how horrible my life felt when i was on medical leave i remember falling behind on child support having to borrow money from my parents i remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her i remember trying to convince an insurance company that i am sick while simultaneously trying to convince myself that i can get better i remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me i guess what i am saying is i know right now i am suffering from depression and i am afraid of what might happen if i admit that again

1,what is the point anymore with love after nearly a year of struggling to stay happy from what happened between my ex and i and trying not to do relationships anymore i let myself slip and gave myself a chance with this one girl who is amazing and nice and kind and such just to be thrown away after one fucken week we work together and she liked me alot but since i am a manager and she is an employee we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my gm who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why his response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just this week when she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it would not be a good idea anymore since she does not want to lose her job exactly one week of dating and i already lost someone that i did not want to go away just like that like yeah i am a bit sad but not enough to cry or anything but it just like i was so fucken happy again i started to smile something i have not done in months and it just felt nice but now i am back to my depressed state of being lonely as usual and just play games work and goto sleep and repeat that day after day until i end it all this is why i try my best not to date or get attached to anyone because if i try to date it will just end badly for me i just want to be happy and have someone close

1,random girl asked me awful question today not sure if this is the right place to post this or not but i need to get this off my chest struggled with depression for about years now and had my highs and my lows recently been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up but still friends and she supports me and my birthday is coming up soon so i was looking forward to that today though i decided to go to subway to get a melt and i was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me i thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked you a serial when my heart sank i had just shaved and i realize not the best looking guy in the world but i know how strangers perceived me i kept a calm demeanor until i got back to my car and i just complete broke down and i was bawling all the way home i know why it hurt so much but i felt like complete shit trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so i hope sharing this relieves me a little bit i am nervous about sharing this though just shocked that someone could say that sorry for the formatting on mobile i know if this is the right sub for this either i just needed to get this off my chest
1,i cannot study not even the thing i like the most i love history i picked it this year and i can even take it as a hobby i am in contemporary history my favorite period and i have an exam on wwi and the ussr it is a lot but that has never been a problem for me but i cannot study it i turn my phone off i get rid of all kind of distraction but i cannot i have given up i have been days trying to study but my brain cannot keep the info i am going to fail and the worst part is that i am passionate about this subject
1,i always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossiploving family made this impossible for me to do not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends family members with something like hey clara he wants to go to the therapist is this normal which one should we call do you know anyone ask john please and next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying hey are you fine making it feel like something is wrong with me when i just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe how do i know because my sister was depressed once and i have seen how everyone reacted to it you see my familys never changing mentality is we need to fight together we are there for you goddamn fairy tail guild or something i do not blame them and i bet there are people whod exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive but i have always hated attention so much since i remember my self as a kid ironically enough i have had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this weird hate doing it secretly will be risky because i actually work in my familys business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible and if someone finds out i secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them maybe i am overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes i wish i could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out sorry if this feels like i am trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions it is way more complicated than that i just wanted to let it out i have read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and i felt better because i said to my self yo you are being a bitch right now look at these people suffering here you are not even close do not know if i am being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer anyways idk why i have not visited this sub earlier as i type these last words i already feel better because it is the first time i am doing something like this feels like i have talked to someone thank you
1,i have posted a few times on these forums and everyone has always been so helpful and supportive so i am hoping i can get some help with this for the last few weeks my depression has been so horrendous worse than it is ever been that i have not been able to go to work i keep calling in sick and then when i can finally make myself go i hide in the bathroom crying or go to an empty office not in my cubicle and call my mother and cry to her i have been in touch with my pdoc who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor granted it is at my request as he is not on my insurance however he is not willing to put me on any other types of medications since he will not be seeing me regularly i have spoken to my long time pdoc from dallas my hometown and he knows me very well i trust him more than any other doctor which is not saying much but he says that i am unipolar aka major depressive disorder and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressants are not working was taking celexa just upped to when this all started i am seeing a new pdoc that is covered by my insurance on monday so maybe things will move forward ok so back to the work thing my supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem in all fairness i have not told her details i find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem she suggested that i talk to human resources about taking some type of leave if i do not know when i will be better i am working on that and hoping one of these doctors will sign for me the biggest problem i have is the guilt over missing work i never imagined that the depression could get so bad that i could not just suit up and show up that is been my motto every time things get rough i guess i am looking for validation here if i really do have it in my to get to work i certainly cannot find it i am a very responsible person so this is not like me the only time i have ever called in sick is when i was having depression issues but never more than one day everyone gets a sick day and i never get the flu or anything so i do not feel guilty about those days what do i do am i looking at this the wrong way it is so hard to be objective when you are so low my saving grace is that my parents who are far away in dallas are being the most supportive people in the world they believe me when i say i just cannot get to work since that is not like me but that is not like them either so i know they want me to get there if i can thanks to anyone who took the time to read this i am hoping someone else has gone through it and can help
1,hello everyone i am new here i am sarah and in my early thirties i live in europe and found this forum today i just want to share my thoughts and because i was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings i searched for a foreign forum and found it i have been struggling all my life but after a series of events death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent i found myself starting therapy almost years ago at first everything was fine and i was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe i would even meet some one to share my life with after a year of therapy i started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago i also started feeling more and more depressed at first i denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because i was convinced time would heal me well i now know that healing is not that easy over the past two weeks i have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on prozac because it should not make me gain weight she thinks this would be the best ad for me and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said i was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind i might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary i am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization off course i do not want that so i agreed earlier today to start with the medication i am so scared about the side effects and do not know what i will do if i gain weight also i do not think i want to life if i loose my job i think that will push me over the edge i hope i can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again bye for now sarah

1,having just cheated on a girl i have known for over years i have felt not only depressed but also physically sick from the moment i got on the train home at the weekend i am incapable of vomiting because i have a stomach ulcer from years ago as a result of depression at a previous job i have repeatedly apologized profusely to her and today was told that she would not be able to see me before she leaves to go back abroad i can only hope at this stage that she will contact me when she returns to the uk the worst part is that i do not seem to have a reason for going with the other girl
1,she stopped texting back hi i am and for as long as i remember i have always struggled with selfconfidence and my depression i rarely use tinder because i do not match with many people i am below average looking like but it does not help swiping for ages and rarely getting a match i know it is just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night i matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking one thing leads to another and next thing i know we are up to after talking about pokémon of all things i feel like there is a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes it took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh we kept talking the next day and that evening she did not reply to one my texts i tried to think nothing of it because it was not really a question or anything and tried to restart the conversation but nothing again this morning i said hi and she replied hey back and then i asked her what she was up to and she just did not reply again i do not blame her if she is not interested that is fair enough it happens she was sending xs up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong i kind of just wish i knew where i went wrong i just feel so unattractive and like there is something wrong with me i know this probably sounds really petty and unimportant but it really hurts and i just needed to vent

1,i lost my father recently and now i have less suicidal thoughts this is not going to be what you think it is going to be if you read the title you are probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues he was not i loved him very dearly i am extremely sad he passed away while i am in such a young age i am but cest la vie i guess the reason i am now less likely to commit suicide is actually i will not cannot do this to my mother we had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it is expensive already we were on the line of poverty and this did not quite help i just cannot do it to my mother to spend even more money that she does not really have so now the feeling of guilt if i were to do it is bigger than my misery now i just slate the days away it is hard but there is no other option for me right now

1,abnormal i am so used to being depressed and anxious i am amazed how people can act normally in general i am like how do they do it i am so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that its normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations the fact that people everywhere do not have to deal with this everyday and just can be themselves without breaking a nervous sweat blows my mind i feel abnormal and tired of it this is the part people do not understand i have met shy people and they are effective communicators once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking when you are overcome with social anxiety depression and feelings of incompetency its damn near impossible to speak or want to every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time its not heard or not what you meant to say so frustrating i cannot explain it but its killing me how i feel and how incapable i am in saying what i feel
0,hello and blessed be to all well this is the beginning of my new journal i had one on aol but for personal reasons moved my writings of my escapades to bloggerland i have also had numerous physical journals and i have only recently started online journals as you can see i love to write it is one of my greatest passions and sometimes i must write to feel better i am also just as passionate about history theater and paganism so i guess you could call me a pagan writeractorhistorian lil bit bout myself my names brian and i am living in hartford ct i go to bulkeley high school and the academy of the arts and i am overall happy with that i am a senior now and life does not seem any different i guess it is because of my up bringing that i feel like that you see i live with my mother stepfather and three brothers and our familys pretty boring for all you kids out there with no siblings i hate you you are too lucky siblingsespecially brotherscan be a pain in the arse trust me i have three of them a couple of things have made my existence a bit more bearable firstly my faith i am a proud and outofthebroomcloset pagan who loves the great mother i have been pagan for five years and my specialty is healing and the tarot i have more pagan books than i do not know who and for the most part they were worth the money i am also blessed with the gift of the arts i have dabbled in just about all the arts painting photography songwriting puppetry but my two favorites are theater and writing though i do not want to be a professional actor i still at least want to be an amateur actor amateurism deserves more dedication than a hobby but not as much as a profession i just love the theater but being a professional actor is too harsh a life for me i want to be a history professor it is not as exciting as being an actor but i love it nonetheless it is also a very flexible career and it will allow me to writemy other passion i hope to one day be a published author but right now i am just writing i usually never finish a story or elaborate an idea but at least i am writing it down eh i write all kinds of shtuff but short stories are my speciality as i continue to write in my journal i will slip in a piece or two to entertain any and all well that is enough writing for now enjoy my escapades
1,this girl i do not really know walked up to me and drew a heart on my paper i know it is something so small and meaningless but it made me really feel better my day was really hard and some portions i felt as if i was going to start crying i despise myself and the fact that someone can walk up to me and draw something kind of sweet and cute on my paper makes me feel less gross and insecure sadly my awkward self did not respond very fast and by the time my brain was able to form a aww thank you she walked away thanks trinity that was really nice it really did make me feel better

1,i am and have been depressed since i was maybe years old i was emotionally abused by two confused parents depression alcoholism runs rampantly in my family fortunately i escaped the alcoholism i was diagnosed as having major depression when i was about and i have been on medication since then i have also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject nothing erases the stigma depression is misnamed it should be called serotonindeficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it too many say depression snap out of it or do something to cheer yourself up what bunk it affects every part of your body last year i realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure i escaped dialysis and will probably be ok but what a relief to have something serious to blame my problems on everybody respects kidney failure as a real disease i had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment very typical reaction from him although the rest of my family were supportive i now have no brother i should have done it a long time ago it takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life i am intelligent employed and do not do drugs or alcohol never have but sometimes i feel like a bum a worthless waste of space not worth the effort i have to argue myself out of that mindset every day and it is so exhausting and people wonder why i am tired all the time and have no energy i am very angry too i have never had a successful relationship and do not believe i ever can i do not even believe it exists no kids either but maybe that is a good thing they take a lot of emotional energy anyway i hate to sound like a whiner but sometimes you have got to whine and i am happy to listen to everybody else and give them my support we are all in the same boat here

0,new york who is in the wrong here i am a little upset over a disagreement with one of my best friends that occurred in late august and has resulted in us not speaking or hanging out since we are in college and we were out together at a party we were talking to some random guys and i left because i saw my ex and was talking to him my friend texted me asking where i was and i told her i was talking to him she told me to go to her and i said okay and asked if he could come then she just said i will just go home see you later i was like no do not leave alone i will come with you without him but she kept refusing my offer and ignored my calls when i tried to find her when she got home she complained to my other friend that i ditched her and made her walk home alone when i offered to go to her and tried to get to her before she left since then she said she was taking time for herself whatever that means and literally has not contacted me since i have tried apologizing numerous times and being normal but she is not really having any of it and says she is not mad at me we have not spoken in around months now and i am really upset because i did not feel like i did anything wrong for one of my best friends to hold some sort of weird grudge and i miss her did i fuck up
1,so i finally realized something this week been stuck in an episode since my birthday just turned as per my last post cannot remember the last time i ate a proper meal sleep cycle is fucked have not left the house in a week funny enough i had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today only to never leave the house all this time i have been thinking how much i yearn to have someone anyone physically check in or a partner to cuddle with hug and hold me tight but all that just fades into the empty void i used to be christian and used to pray now that i am not i am realizing how truly alone i am in dealing with all this my friends all live in the city center they have jobs and livelihoods ultimately i have to physically do things by myself no ones going to save me it is heartbreaking physically i am just so alone

0,gossiping in the family hello i am not sure whether this fits in this sub but i am going to ask it anyway my family is a known gossiper all of them tend to gossip about me i am the odd ball the one who does not agree with them the one they all tend to chat about many times we have arguments they all gain up on me i will have my mom dad and older sisters all attacking my character telling me i am no good and that i am poison i have caught them in a few instances but they brush it off often they pretend i am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like i did nothing we said nothing sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me it is really bothersome it makes me feel so betrayed confused and really angered i also not my family learns things about me before i even told them mainly negative there are lists of inconsistent gaps i try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me they try to cover up their tracks and always tell me i am paranoid i know lots of the advice will be to confront them but i do not believe that will work i have tried that all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when i catch them saying things about me my mother does it the most often she gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad sometimes my sisters gossip about me together i have become the play thing in the family my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for it is hurts it is hard not to give a shot because it is your own family i have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often it is also wrong to play the same game what should i do i really am at a loss

0,should i cut my losses amp move on i have a coworker amp friend that gotten to know really well since we started working together almost years ago he seemed a bit socially awkward so i befriended him we started hanging out amp we shared some pretty deep things with each other not big on emotions but he said he just feels comfortable talking to me about things however a self proclaimed friend he wants friendships on his rules his terms amp there is no real sense of urgency in getting back to you not text me back for days when i check on him he tells me i worry a worrier by nature he says he owe me anything yet tells me one of the only people who has ever shown him unconditional love in a friend sort of way one of my biggest pet peeves is when people ignore me i am sure he knows that amp he does it on purpose at times but i also know just who he is based on how other coworkers talk about him at work i can be very overbearing at times myself i try not to be but i get really insecure about our friendship if he just ignores me like i did something wrong to warrant being ignored i just feel like this friendship is so up amp down he has no regard for my feelings or how his actions make me feel he thinks emotions are dumb he says they just because problems amp people get hurt he literally almost never shows emotion in any situation however i have seen him cry before amp i know he is capable of loving someone he claims he has no love to give because he has such a poor opinion of himself never had a friendship that has been this difficult to maintain i always feel like doing something wrong like walking on eggshells thinking about just ending the friendship but we still work together i tend to get very passive aggressive when i am hurt i know i will start to get that way at work toward him while he will be as polite amp professional as can be because how he is he controls his emotions so well i just know what to do tl dr thinking of ending a friendship with a coworker after becoming very close feels like walking on eggshells

0,i love that word ponderings if you break it up you get pond like lake eh like oh ring like disaster because wedding rings do tend to end up in disaster so pondering is like dipping into a lake of disaster mmmm maybe if i shut my eyes i will be able to feel the waves washing over me hear the delicate ripples as leaves fall into my pond and breathe in the air of immortality if the philosophers stone is a soluble tablet my lake of disaster is the solution for it like in chemistry i dreamt the other night that i was in a cold dark lake and that i was below watching the world through a rippled mirror i saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view when it was finally clear again all there was was a star that lit up the lake and in the middle of the star there was me spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater i reached out to feel the wetness on my hair but i felt only heat as the star plunged into the icy water and i melted into oblivion i love random dreams
1,i do not like when people ask how are you because instead of saying i googled the prices of veterinary xanax this morning because i am seeking any kind of relief from this inescapable malaise and selfworthlessness i have been battling for the last years i have remind myself that they are not actually asking how i am and that it is just a greeting and that i have to say ahh yknow just living so they do not worry i wish someone would ask how i am and actually care about the answer

0,today is shaping up to be an extremely frustrating day for some reason whenever b has guard duty the kids think that it is a good time to be their most obnoxious and to top it all off my period is due tomorrow which cuts my tolerance in half i have been so exhausted the last couple of days i am not sure if there is something going around or if it just the years of interupted sleep that is finally catching up with me i have no energy and all i want to do is eat i need to get out and do something still mulling over the idea of a move to al sometimes the thought of starting over in a new place is very refreshing and at other times terrifying truth is though i probably do not have the drive to move this whole family and i know that b is pretty happy right where we are if he got a little better job we would probably be very comfortable and would not even be considering a move i have done so much work with tweaking his resume and getting it out there that every time he has an interview and it does not work out it almost feels like a rejection of me stupid i know and he totally takes it in stride but i am starting to get frustrated that people do not see his potential and qualifications well i should really get busy and get something done today there is a ton of laundry to put away and maybe i will bake something it is a gorgeous day out and not too hot yet so it is great weather for baking
0,for the last few days i have had some interviews to work as a teacher in a new school still under construction i would love to do so i am awaiting answer as for a second interview i think i can be able to do so it is just that i do not know whether the girls i had contact with are serious or not i told them about the salary i would like to have the regular one for a foreign language teacher in hk and i understand that it might not be possible i am already disppointed before the answer because i feel like it will be no
1,this is the nicest group of people on the internet i would come here everyday even if there was not so much helpful advice on here especially when i am having a particularly bad time when i do not even feel like playing my instead of just staring at my game library i open up this subreddit makes me feel like i am not alone and with everything shitty going on in this world and all the shitty people around meus it is really comforting to see a community online that is being so nice and helpful to each other
1,i think i might be depressed even when i am having an ok life is it possible i will try to keep this as short as possible no one likes a wall of text just as the tittle said is it possible or i am just seeing it all wrong summary i am a years old dude neet at the moment life was never hard or cruel to me do not have many friends but all the friends i have are delightful to me also my family puts no pressure on me and they are pretty positive overall the only trauma i experienced so far was the breakup with my ex but i moved on totally forgot about her just an ordinary life in general but yet i cannot help but notice the subtle changes of my outlook and in how i feel about life i was happygolucky my entire life until the end phase of but then something happened not sure when or why because looking back nothing real bad happened to me yet i started to feel more and more indifferent as each day passes at one point i even stopped contacting people around me because i was like talk is ok but no talk is ok too and even today i still feel that way i still feel joy and moods in life like eating good food cry from very sob movies but at the end of the day there is always something it is not feeling the same like how i had felt my entire life i think it might be because i have no dreams or passions like other folks in my life but i was always like that and i was always fully content with it on a positive note good thing is i do not have any suicidal thoughts
1,i give up trying eat healthy exercises blah fucking blah the point when i still fucking wake up wanting to die and cry myself to sleep every night just lost all hope i think some people are made for this life and others are just not and one of those people when will the day come i imagine suicide or my own funeral been non stop hell for years and i see it ever getting better i hope for the rest of you it does i really do but for me just given up ran out of hope
1,i am so fucking lonely my husband is my best friend he is my dude and when he is busy i have friends to fall back on as well recently the whole family got back to back sickness and we were basically quarantined for two weeks just bumming around trying to get better so i let my kid watch too much tv let my husband play all the video games so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well let me also say i did not plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end but i have to shower and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever no now that were better his behaviors have continued even though i have spoke to him many times things will not be like this when were not longer sick my kid is not a tv kid and i plan to keep it that way as long as i can but he he does not want to spend time with me any more just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together so i wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom and i realized i do not have very many friends edit i do not care about this getting up votes or anything but sharing it makes me feel a little less lonely also sorry for any spelling grammatical errors i am usually obsessive but i feel like shit tldr husband plays games stops communicating with me realized he is my only true friend
1,will i ever be with somebody i am so lonely i am and i do not have a clue what a relationship feels like all my friends are talking about marriage and i have never even had a real kiss i cared about i did not think i was that bad i guess i was wrong i know there are people who go much longer without finding anyone special but i really hope that does not happen to me i have spent so long being someone i am not and now i do not know how to actually be myself anymore i feel so depersonalized and isolated i need someone to tell me it is ok i have so many deep problems and i cannot talk about them i do not want sex i want someone who can hold me and reassure me that i do not need to die to feel at peace i just want to cuddle and talk is that too much to ask i do not even care who man woman other i do not care and still i cannot fucking find anyone i cannot even find real friends i give up it is probably too late for me anyway alcohol is the only thing i have a real relationship with

1,the only thing that can happen in such a boring world is terror or something did you se the footage from monrovia that is in liberia for any americans who might be reading this i cannot understand how these kids are just walking around firing their aks as if they are hanging out after school you do not tend to see the other side but i assume it is the same there was a shot of a group of kids nonchalantly lounging around on the back of a pickup truck upon which was mounted an oldfashioned looking heavy machinegun the kind with an armored shield and mounted on a pivot maybe a mobile antiaircraft gun the truck was not moving the gun was in use so why were a bunch of kids just sitting there do not human beings usually seek to protect themselves from danger why do people involved in a fire fight walk around as if they were popping out to the shops for a six pack and a box of b h despite weeks service in the israeli army i have yet to experience any sort of hostile activity which goes beyond the emotional what do you do when everything you were told turned out to be bullshit and you realize that everyone you know is deluded i have started to experience intense rages which appear to be provoked by my girlfriend who it seems thinks that the purpose of a relationship is to psychoanalyze ones partner destructively to the point of inducing a breakdown or something i have lashed out at her hitting and screaming and have during intense screaming matches to beat my fists against the wall this is the best i can do to prevent myself from smashing her to pieces my right hand still hurts me from a couple of days ago she closes the windows to try to spare the neighbors any unpleasantness god knows what they must think like i could give a fuck i am inconsiderate i am selfish i am a bastard i have a cold attitude to others i am a snob i have contempt for everyone i do not know which is my stuff and which is hers i am thinking more of suicide these days i used to have the regular teenage fascination with my mortality and the potential termination thereof we were going to try for a baby but she has a hormonal condition which seems quite serious i have to go wank in a jar and see if my tadpoles are doing whatever it is they should do she wants me to consider going off with another woman to procreate if it turns out she is infertile this fills me with rage i will not tell you why if you do not understand this you do not understand what does anyone understand is life ever going to change i am starting to suffer from a new sort of depression i am starting to feel like i am and the old passion is really not there anymore everything is hopeless but it cannot ever change i want to hurt myself and have a fantasy to kill myself with my leatherman ahahahahaha

0,so i am back from my family vacation and it was alright i guess the best thing about the whole trip was actually seeing my entire immediate family divorced parents my sister and her children my son and myself together family is a blessing and i am grateful for it i did get a chance to spend some time on the beach by myself i am glad that i called my main home girl who advised me to claim what i needed and that was some time without my son being on the beach and standing in front of water and talking to god was very refreshing i asked god to give me clarity with my relationship with him then things got interesting i got an phone call from keys and he expressed to me that it would have been nice if i came to visit him and asked how i would have responded to advances he may have made after all this time i really do honor our friendship and would not want to cross any lines that cannot be reversed plus i must honor what he and i are experiencing now and must give the respect that i ask of him right

0,i and a friend of mine had a dispute which questions our friendship tldr op misread the situation by telling a joke to which his drunk friend took offence and revealed to ops other friends ops buried drug habit ops friends now know things op originally wanted to be left in the past my friend let us call him t for now and i had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other t was very drunk and gave some information i kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time he mentioned the last time i got high but he did mention how long ago this is important because i have had an on and off history of depression which i have been struggling with years and i previously i used to combat it by developing a drug habit i have been working hard to be clean for years and i have kept all this under the rug because i did not wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible or be denied respect as their friend i buried my past and drug habits for good doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing i felt i like i myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time he did all this because i had made a joke in this particular conversation to which he reacted negatively and said i ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so because of this people i trust now are asking me if i do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me some people i am friends with are asking me if i need counselling though i am clean i am not sure if i can forgive him and it is made me feel less than a person which is something i have not felt in years i feel worthless again and i am not quite sure i can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life should i cut ties with t what should i do if now my other friends might not see me the same way anymore

1,alienating family do you ever get tired of saying you are okay when you are not but you do not want to talk about it so instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what is going on with you my family has never been super close we get along with each other and talk to each other but we are not a support system and i do not feel comfortable talking to them about my problems i feel like i will be judged and gossiped about so i just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away the only person in this world i feel i can talk to about my problems are my husband and i know that is a huge burden on him to be my only outlet my only friend it is putting a strain on our relationship and i blame myself for this it is a lot of pressure to put on someone living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances whatever normal is but add the burden of being the only friend the only person that knows the only person period eventually that only person is going to get tired of it

0,new baby and chemo hey all i am new here just got diagnosed on thursday triple negative receptor stage right breast lump awaiting my brca results and am getting a chemo port put in on monday to start chemo very soon i am years old have one month old son and am weeks pregnant due with a second baby i have done some research about what is to come but i am also just trying to take everything one day at a time because my anxiety takes me to terrible places anyway i was told i would start very soon on ac chemo sorry if some of my terms are incorrect i was at doctors office all yesterday and it was very surreal so still sorting things out i was told that i would stop chemo about weeks before delivery and then i would start up after the baby arrives to finish out my treatment i have read a little bit about chemo and i know that i will not be able to breastfeed i was wondering about bed sharing though i read that you have to be cautious after the chemo treatments flushing twice washing sheets if any bodily fluids get on it etc but i wondered is bed sharing allowed are the chemicals so intense that this might harm a newborn andor my toddler son i am trying to find answers here so i can prepare myself for what is to come i will be attending a chemo info session this coming week but i would love to hear from women who have been through this and i guess just hear some feedback i am not interested in opinions about the safety of bed sharing overall strictly about the potential affects to a newborn and potentially my toddler son also interested in any other topics that maybe i am not thinking about in regards to doing all of this with a newborn and toddler thank you all for listening
1,it is and i cannot sleep i have got so many thoughts rushing through my head i have tried writing them down and drawing pictures and doing mind numbing things to try and stop me thinking but it is not working i just feel so angry for no particular reason i feel really violent and have been having thoughts about hurting people i am not that kind of person i have not cut for nearly months and i just attacked my legs with a broken glass because i had to get it out of my system somehow i do not know what is going on i have not been depressed lately i have been feeling pretty good really i thought i was just getting things back under control and now whoosh i am losing control again i just want to stop thinking i am actually thinking about banging my head against the wall until my brain slows down
1,everything has changed about four years ago i was the typical loner i was in the middle school nobody took me seriously because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else i am from a small town so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things i did at the time i liked things like anime video games and mlp i am a year old lass now and i only like video games now in the final grade of my middle school i met a girl she was about two years younger but liked the same things i did i was so happy to finally meet someone like me we have bonded a lot and she was the first person i truly loved except for my family of course about two years ago we started to get distant she kept talking to me about things i was uncomfortable with but whenever i tried to talk about something that bothered me she told me she was busy and did not hear me out it escalated in june of i started talking to her friends because they seemed like such wonderful people to me then we met up all of us she kept crying and making scenes few weeks before that she accused me of liking her friends more than i liked her but when we all met it seemed alright save for her crying etc when i got home the next day she told me off really badly she told me to go to hell called me all sorts of names and i feared i feared i would never be able to find someone like her again i tried to end it swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol i woke up the next day in a hospital i woke up to a text from her one that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girls dogs it is been two years i have gotten better met friends that helped me out a lot and i will probably never be able to repay it but this past of mine it still haunts me i do not think i will ever be able to trust someone like this again i have gotten so cynical and careless about everything it still hurts
1,struggled with depression and anxiety for years and made it through hi everyone i just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going new to reddit so i hope this is okay struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and honestly been the most difficult thing ever dealt with mental illness is silently crippling spent more nights than i can remember wracked with sobs feeling incredibly alone and fantasizing about suicide spent more days than i can remember feeling hollow being apathetic and not caring about what happened to me depression is a fucking bitch and even now when i actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future not naive enough to think that never have to struggle with my mental health again but i think i have learned how to best cope with it medication work for me and while i do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness it make a big difference in my case but i learned to focus on the present to rely on loved ones lucky enough to have and to forgive myself take it one small step at a time so what if you leave your room today that fucking hard you got up and you got out of bed the first step learn to love yourself even through the despair and selfloathing there is no one path to overcoming depression and sometimes not exactly the cureall you envisioned but rather learning to live with it but i promise you all that one day it will be better you will be happy again and until then happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions

1,i want to die trigger warning trigger warning my trauma happened when i was i am now and still suffer from it daily i actually suppressed the trauma completely until i was when it all came back to me so i guess i have only really been dealing with it for years now i have severe ptsd severe depression anxiety severe panicanxiety attacks ocd severe memory loss and had an intense eating disorder for years that i am still struggling with constantly i have not gotten a good nights sleep in years i have constant ptsd nightmares regular nightmares and insomniaconstant fatigue and exhaustion i also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half i have been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems and honestly wish i could go back sometimes i was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal my home environment was constantly hostile i go through long periods of feeling suicidal currently in that period do not know what to do honestly years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet i still am nowhere near being close to healthy looking back i cannot even remember the last time i was genuinely happy the periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm i am so afraid of waking up when i am and still feeling the same way i do now the thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions i have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a ged because i could not find the will to do schoolwork when i was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again i afford college because i do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep i have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead i have any real thoughtout because i was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out i said i wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through it does not seem fair that i went through this trauma hadhave all of this mental illness and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses it does not seem fair that i am suffering so much still i do not know what to do anymore i am tired of trying so fucking hard i know this is selfpitying and emo but i just do not know what to do i have no one to talk to i really just want to die

1,reddit secret santa saved my life i want to begin this by saying that i have been in a really dark place recently combination of family issues breakup and finals put me in a really depressive state as a result i had been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks i had been seriously thinking about ending my own life so that is the context in which this occurs about a month ago i signed up for secret santa on a whim i had never done it before and honestly did not expect anything but yesterday my gift arrived i do not know who this person is but they spent at least dollars on about separate gifts they also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought i was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me i immediately broke down crying upon reading it it might seem small or sorta stupid but it made me feel like someone cared about me that i was not the idiotic nobody my depression tells me i am all of the time i felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks i cleaned my room and did work that i had been ignoring for months i finally felt like maybe just maybe i meant something it changed my life and probably saved it so whoever you are thank you so much and i cannot express how much this meant to me or thank you enough and let this be a lesson to everyone else the smallest act can and does make a difference let us all try and use the christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved
1,i think i may have been on this forum it looked different back in when i had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries i have always been prone to this i guess but i am starting to figure out that it is big nasty lifechanges that trigger it well here i go again this time it is relationshiprelated my wife and i are on brink of divorce i found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man and was no longer inlove with me we somehow muddled through the next several months even though i found out it was still going on we kept trying anyway and things were still tolerable and ok i guess we still shared same bed got affectionate cuddled and even made love about weeks ago i discovered that it still had not ended and they were actually conspiring on getting together in march well all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever i am now in a separate room sleeping on a single bed and i am miserable i resumed wellbutrin when this all started last spring i took wellbutrin for about months when i had my episode in and have been taking it since but since this really bad turn of events i knew i could not take it and to be honest even before i discovered again my therapist told me that i need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because i have got some serious anxiety issues so now i just started zoloft in addition to the wellbutrin i do not know how things are going to turn out i am in limbo while i give her time and space to figure things out the zoloft i think started to kick in today but not in a good way i am actually feeling more depressed when i came in this morning i almost broke down crying in front of my computer argh my mood swings are horrible all i can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an ambien even though i hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife i almost wish at times that she would just say that is it we are done so i can know what is going on and just move on with my life i may end up single and lonely anyway but at least i will have the opportunity to look for someone else right now i feel like a prisoner being starved of basic human needs like hugs touches affection does not that sound lame from a guy well anyway here i am here for the ride

1,sometimes i stand in front of the mirror and think why would anyone ever love you why is it so hard for people to accept me
1,lunch yesterday in a busy citycentre bar full of lawyers drinking wine n expensive suits folders of documents n brief snippets of conversations waft past me there were indictments on the file gales of laughter ice buckets steak sandwiches bowls of pasta i sat in a free space a couple of seats away from a young woman and waited for my food downing bitter shandy in the heat i then became aware that my neighbor was conducting a continuous conversation with herself at first i thought she was talking to me and turned to look caught her eye and realized her conversation mostly murmured not at all intrusive continued throughout the hour or so i spent there always addressed to herself alone or to a figure i could not see every so often she went to the bar and came back with another tall glass of lemonade or perhaps it was fizzy water as she talked she made small jerky gesticulations with her arms in front of her i could not hear what she was talking about n her speech was less loud than the noise from the crowded tables in the centre of the room n but the tone and volume of her conversation rose and fell there was a sense of excitement at times then of humor sometimes of irritation sometimes of the mundanity of everyday speech the bar staff seemed to know her n one of them a tall boy with a goatee came and chatted to her briefly i finished my food n which was not that great n read the paper drank another beer occasionally watched the lawyers ruminated daydreamed and then left my neighbor stayed on still talking still sipping her lemonade
0,i feel like i am annoying my friend i have noticed recently that i have been texting my friend a lot and the one to always start the conversation the thing is i am usually the shy one and they are the outgoing one since they start conversations i feel like i am annoying them or bothering them what do you guys think has something like this happened to you
1,i want to scream until it stops and the world makes sense again update a few good days had me fooled into thinking i had control over myself and my life the only thing holding back from suicide is my mother and how much killing myself would fuck her up but she is in her and as soon as she is gone i do not see anything else holding me back from following after i just want to stop existing i just want it all to stop

1,i suffer from major depression too and i have taken almost all of the ssris but the only one that really helped me was lexapro i took it for around months then decided that i did not want to become addicted to another medication so i just stopped taking it and it did not bother me at all i have been taking mil of elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but i take it to help me sleep it used to help control my depression but it does not anymore and really does not help me sleep either have you ever tried lexapro i think it is the best ssri one can be on and i had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it if there is an alternative treatment for major depression i would like to know what it is i really have no reason to be depressed as i have a very loving supportive husband wonderful children grandchildren and greatgrand children both my husband and i are retired and this is a time when i should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which i cannot explain i do not want for anything i have a beautiful home a new durango but the material things am not what makes one happy i have been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but i certainly do not choose to be unhappy and i do not know anyone who would i am a devout christian and i know that my depression is not coming from god but i am letting the devil tell me that i am depressed maybe god is just trying to bring me closer to him and i need to lay my burden of depression at his feet and tell him that i cannot get through this alone then just forget about it but for me it is not that easy three of my children are taking antidepressants so i guess depression might be hereditary spelling i will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too thank you

1,just wanted to share hey first time posting here just wanted to talk to someone there since is not really any option irl i just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap probably not news to anyone here that is how it usually goes but tonight i feel okay i recently decided just to drop everything and run away not the first time i have done it i have gotten good at it actually and have been just sitting while i wait for finances to become ready this is a record low point in my life but tonight i changed how i feel about it by just getting some chores done getting drunk and treating myself the way i wish other people would treat me i am talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the and it dawns on me that i will get another chance i may have fucked things up this time but i have bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so i am probably going to do so again there will be more chances to treat people the way i want to be treated no matter what age i get to i do not need someone to be nice to me all i have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people it is a silly sentiment but it is all i got right now i hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it if you pray pray for me in the next three months because it is all i got ask me for some nice nice words and i will give some to you as personally as i can things get better when you are kind to others no matter what the haters might tell you
0,my first post in this new journal that i have opened and am right now trying to think of something interesting to write my name is not catelina but i have had friends think that it was because i get referred to it very often my sister calls me catelina marguerita and once when i told a friend that and i commented that i was an alcoholic drink they said delicious it gains some strange perhaps unusual responses i am at university at the moment studying a bachelor of science and am presently contemplating where it will take me in no way whatsoever do i want to be a scientist or a teacher i am enamoured with the idea of becoming a doctor and believe that the glasses which i got a week ago will aid me in my quest to take up this occupation yes i do believe glasses make you smarter it is a nice way to look at things is not it but seven years is an awful long wait to take up when you are craving in the most facist sense to be away from the world of studying i saw a pile of medical lecture notes on sale at the university book store for and was so utterly tempted to pick one up pay for it and go and sit in on the lectures then when i finally get there i will know most of the content and will breeze through the course perhaps i have lived in the same house for all eighteen years of my life and my parents have been married for over years which in this day and age is an achievement in itself seeing as so many of my friends parents are divorced separated or estranged i have a friend who has moved so often in her life and craves to leave the place where she lives right now and for a time in our past was so angry at me i have come to realise that i did not want to go with her but what people do not seem to understand is that living in the same house for so long with parents who still love each other and siblings who are not on antidepressents is a remarkable albeit maybe boring life i cannot think of a place i would rather be even if i have only been on a plane once in my life and that was six months ago
0,so friday the hmmmmm either something good will happen or something bad will happen or maybe it will be like the rest of my life and nothing at all will happen i have rediscovered why i do not stage manage any more i am so bored watching this show and i would feel bad about sitting there and reading grrrr well only more and if one more actor comes to me with a brilliant idea i am going to have to kill them maybe if they knew all there lines or all there songs or did not goof things up every night i would listen to them but i wonder why they are worried about other peoples blocking but do not seem to care that they have no idea what they are doing

1,i am i say this to myself all the time sjw i never thought i would be in this position but i am and so are you i can relate to you on many levels if i did not work for my father i am sure i would be unemployed due to my concentration problems attendance problems uneven mood and unpredictable production level so i am very lucky i can see what challenges you face i often thought that i might like to go into some sort of counseling because of my life experiences also do you live in a big enough city that you can apply at some mental health clinics or government aid departments sometimes the willingness to do that kind of work can get you in the door it may be entry level but you could work up if it were a job that satisfied your needs what about like an activity director at a youth home or a retirement villagesenior home or a special needs program here our recreation commission has a special populations program that coordinates trips and activities for the special population of the area they go on ski trips and day trips and it looks very fun of course it takes a certain frame of mind to be able to work with the special population of the world but i just mention it because you talked about counseling i just wanted to clarify that although i am very lucky to have an income it really fuels my depression sometimes to think about how i am letting my dad down or causing him extra crap to deal with so lucky and not so lucky

1,whatever happened to doctor patient confidentiality i applied for short term disability because depression is affecting my job and i am barely function able at work the insurance company made me sign a waiver of privacy to both my therapist and psychiatrist now they can call them up and ask anything they want the insurance company called me yesterday for a telephone interview they wanted me to explain why i needed the time off what my symptoms are how long have i been like this really personal questions they are going to be the ones who determine whether i can get disability pay or not whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor i wonder who the insurance company can tell i forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential they also asked how this is affecting my job i felt if i gave the wrong answer they will decide not to pay me i wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks and how much info the shrinks can give them also i understand that the shrinks therapists can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another that i can understand but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctors and they have to tell all that is ridiculous what happens if i am just a witness to some crime but did not do the crime what happens if the lawyers want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut i am just ranting but opinions feedback would be appreciated

0,i do not know if i am allowed to feel this way i do not have many friends to start with i mean i do but when i count close friends i nearly have none as i am slowly starting to lose them i have great friends amazing friends that were always there for me in the past but i just do not feel any of that anymore and yes i know i should be considerate that they are people that have a life of their own with school and family and all their homework but i feel in a way neglect i asked them for once if they wanted to hang out but they reply with sorry i am busy with homework but then i see that they were making a costume and having a photoshoot with some other friend which would have took hours of work i know i should not say anything and i should be forunate that they still consider me their prized friend however i feel neglected i feel as if they do not even care or want to even care about me anymore because i am the one always chatting in the chat but i get short replies back once in the blue moon it makes me feel like they just stopped because they found someone else on top of that they calmed they were sick and i do believe that they actually had initially told me that they wanted to give me a present for christmas which is rare because they never really give me things once on a blue moon maybe and i only give gifts to them for their birthday but now since they are sick i have a feeling i am going to be told no sorry i am sick and need to relax after finals when they always go out with their other friends for these occasions no matter what i want to say this again but i feel that it is not right that i am feeling disappointed and neglected because a person is allowed to do what they want i am not not allowed to tell them what to do as they have their own life and i would not like that but please my request is may i have some advice about or further insight about what you guys could possibly be seeing in this situation my point of view i feel is too biased because i already know the person and their habits and i have an emotional response to this
0,for those of you who know me reasonably well you might have known that last thursday was my birthday now i will admit it was not exacltly the star filled night of enjoyment that i hoped for but hey you cannot have everything but i did as i do every year made my new years resolutions that night because for me the of august is my new year i decided to have these as my resolutions a couple of pages of notes or one page of new writing everyday actually start wearing the nice clothing that people buy for me and even experiment with a colour that is not black socialise quite a bit more often what do you guys think what resolutions have you guys ever made josh
0,but there are a couple of things i have been thinking about does it make me a bad person that i want to just quit my alumni group heres the problem i am the president of our chapter i have been for about a year and a half but it is not like i volunteered for it or at least not without a bit of arm twisting from the expresident and now i cannot find anyone to arm twist myself and i want out there is just not enough time in the day to dream up events organize them send out a mass email announcing them reply to responses etc then i have to actually show up at the event early to get seats and talk to people well the talk to people part is not horrible the showing up early is the one that always kills me i have to show up early enough to ensure enough seats for everyonee who is coming half of which probably did not rsvp but late enough that i do not have to fight off the waitor for too long with promises of a coming party uchhkk let us see what else oh yeah i finally found a new apartment i am pretty excited it is a one bedroom so i shall be living by myself for the first time ever that is pretty nifty in some aspects i can clean at my own pace and only clean up after myself i can invite people over or not at my own discression i can decorate exactly as i like it will be like heaven except i am hoping i do not become a hermit someone at work today joked that i shall be a cat lady i will not buy a cat i promise hopefully it will not be so bad my current roommate will still be relatively close she and her fiancee are moving in together my cousin will moving with his wife to a condo very close to my new place thatll be pretty nifty because i think we might be good friends we have never lived close enough to try before but i have always enjoyed hanging out with him and his wife when i have gotten the chance oh and i shall moving close to some friendsofafriend that i am decently good friends with too and that i have always wanted to be better friends with so hopefully it will all turn out well and it is a damn cute apartment
1,hi everyone i am also a new member i am years old and a single mother of one i have had bipolar tendencies since i was a young child and was diagnosed at or the past few years since my daughter was born have been the best ones for my moods i attribute part of that to the success i seemed to have on lithium for two years i stupidly went off the medicines and my thyroid medicines as well in november without telling my doctor lately things have gotten fairly rough i know i have to get back in to the doctor and i will it is just that my life is so busy right now that it is hard to find the time and the courage i am glad i found this great site it is great to hear others stories and to not feel alone so nice to meet you all
0,should social security be run by the government is government good at doing that sort of thing when i attended a student meeting with one of the chairs of the fed in nyc he said that there are two things that the us has to worry about economically in the future the first is the trade deficit turning over and the second is the retirement of the baby boomers now i read your mws post to joe crow about ss funding till but the best estimates i can find the only economist i can find who says otherwise is paul krugman from the nytimes so maybe i am off base since he is a superb economist state that under the payasyougo system within a dozen years the retirement benefits mandated by current law will exceed ss payroll taxes so we are talking about tax increases within our or at least my lifetime fortune article called it the trillion abyss now as you mentioned earlier any serious student of human nature has to look at the world realistically when you put a social safety net just like free health care in place what is going to happen it will be overused that is human nature unless people are given a clever incentive to do otherwise i leave wiggle room here in case forced to recant later people are going to plan on using it not everybody not all the time but those guys on the margin of making a decision on savings will tend to take this retirement benefit into account and god forbid plan on it the system is going to have to handle the stress from the poor and disabled as well as the free riders now that is not say that ss is altogether bad socializing some costs is important but the payasyougo system is totally ridiculous you get one guy who knows about accounting and one guy who knows about demographics in a room together and they will tell you somethings got to give either taxes go up or benefits go down or a little of both maybe another variant would work better but the most libertarians i meet get annoyed when their futures are being taxed away before their eyes sorry about the getting my own thoughts in order and not as concise as like
0,i found out i have a halfbrother from my dads affair years ago should i contact him he is not aware who his real dad is
0,man like of the people in my school are cheating on their english assesments its so easy to and i am tempted to myself coz id rather have a quality essay as opposed to sitting there trying to remembering it and missing out on key points that aside i got a haircut wootemz um nothing really change my wallpaper and from sonique to winamp o o how boring damnit i only got weeks to go and smoke my pipe up her tree i mean ask her out i am not like that okay i was just kidding oh well more weeks plenty of time
0,i guess done with her or is there something wrong with my attitude so in the literature class we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment one of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class the teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly he me did all right that too harsh later i approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade then she rants out all the things done wrong but she spoke so fast that i quite catch all of them and i became a bit angry at her attitude because she spoke so fast so i quite catch of her points which is likely to be intentional so startled before i can argue back majority of her points were about that i lacked explicit points but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough so i said back to her but the teacher said the essay was all she scoffs and says write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass who are you now i really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism but she spoke so fast likely to be intentionally and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough btw she actually achieves better grades than i do and is clearly smarter than i am not trying to be boastful but in this literature class i really think safe to say that i get better grades than her most of the times and not a teacher what the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that especially when she gets lower grades than i do most of the time besides she really always says rude things in front of faces and many many times in front of my face and sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical i guess done with her right or is there something wrong with my attitude i regretted a couple of times being friend with her in the first place and now i really see that there can be no good staying with her and i am in my final year before graduation i feel quite embarrassed that i am complaining about this kind of friendship problem and i know i should be focusing on studying but thinking about this gets me angry every time

0,is it me hello this is my first time posting here so the other day one of my friends texted me saying i think she is dumb and that she demands respect this is a month after i just hung out with her everything seemed fine she then accused me of insulting her and the school she goes to i insisted that she took what i said out of context for example she said i think her major is easy i never said this i said it was not math focused plus she herself said she is having an easy time she constantly asks me if i think she is intelligent and i always tell her she is smart in her own way like everyone is anyway i said sorry and have a good holiday but she did not reciprocate and just told me to watch what i say and not to tell anyone she said this this is not the first time this kind of thing happened one person i know just hates me quote hates you and everything about you he just does and i have no idea why sometimes he is cool other times he ignores me he has pointed out that i am light skinned black and he is dark so apparently i am treated better eveb if that is true i am not responsible for that another person hated me for reasons unbeknownst to me excluded me from group chats and gatherings made this known to others and now i am told they love me largely made up with this person but i never knew why they hated me to begin with i am extremely confused by all of this now i am a guy who was known as the smart quiet kid in school with a lot of knowledge occasionally i will let people know my opinions and they will get a kick out of it however i really made it a point to be polite to people even when i disagreed with them or did not like them most people i know say i am genuinely kind or polite even to the point of being boring i go out of my way to refrain from cracking mean jokes or speaking bluntly because i know it will offend people i try to balance the thoughts in my head and the words i speak is not this normal most people at my current school say i am very nice and friendly am i doing something wrong or are people just being badweird to me tldr i tend to get people who hate me and i do not know why most people say i am a kind and logical person

0,did you ever wonder why people care so much or why anyone shows emotion emotion is pain and happiness all in the same body emotions overwhelm people so much sometimes it seems unbearable but then again its not like we can control what we feel why do people get so angry if someone crys its neither of there faults because they cannot control there emotions today my little brother was playing with my feet and it irritates me so much and he just kept on asking me why i have no idea why that is just how i feel i do not like it can you explain why you feel the way you do about things
0,anyway i cannot sit around raving about the government all day i had a driving lesson today god that guys insane he had me on my second lesson mind and i have never driven before bombing around constitution hill at i almost had a heart attack luckily though i did not and i am still here to type all of this to you yeah well i suppose that scaring the shit out of your students is one way to ensure that they do not drive like idiots when you let them out onto the road after they get their licences i mean my best mate had his p plates for two weeks before he had his first accident and i do not mean a little scraping either i am talking a major hi from hospital thank god you have still got your legs deal he could not walk properly for ages makes you think though when we are more likely to die violently and horrifically than any other age group is the price we pay for a tank of petrol really that important thought for the day did they call bali an act of god

1,my plans for valentines day lay in my bed feel lonely try to cry realize i will never cry again hate myself debate if i should tell someone how shit i feel lay there for the rest of the day
1,i want to share a personal project i am proud of a month ago i was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything i was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be that i am not as close to my family as i used to be that nothing i do at work really matters and that my health is slowly deteriorating i just wanted to quit at everything then i was hanging out with a friend i had not seen in a while and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression so we both opened up about it he ended up recommending the book feeling good to me since it had helped him improve a lot i read it and was initially a bit disappointed some parts were underwhelming some felt annoyingcondescending and the solution to every problem seemed to be the threecolumn technique but after trying a few of the exercises in the book i admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful one of the exercisesquizzes in the book is the depression checklist which as i am sure many of you are aware of assesses your level of depression on a scale from to at the time i was scoring in the moderate range after a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises i was down to the mild range so i decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression what i wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis based on exercising reading socializing meditating etc and then plot that against my daily depression score i wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood ironically what i discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge moodbooster for me since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity as i have gotten further along in the work i have noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again but for a while i was actually in the normal range of depressive emotions i could not believe it regardless the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood even though my mood is not at the level it was a couple weeks ago it is nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction also if anyone is interested in trying out the app feel free to check it out here it is stupid simple and still a work in progress but i am still kind of proud of it and if it were able to help even just one other person that would make me pretty happy
1,getting all excited to do something and then canceling at the last moment for no reason or how to let down six online acquaintances with one easy trick last week i set up an online gaming event that was supposed to take place today it did not get a whole lot of interest relative to the other things on the forum but i happened to have scheduled it very close to another event without realizing so whatcha going to do either way it was enough interest to follow through with it so fast forward to today when i had to write a very apologetic post four minutes before it was due to start deflecting to some bullshit like personal stress shitty time management and just like that i had disappointed everyone involved idk it does not sound like much when it is written down but it is been a while since i have done a last minute cancellation quite that bad and i have just been left feeling really guilty about the whole thing
1,when people with good intentions say the wrong shit how do you deal with it when someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while how do you personally deal with it recently i had an uncle who i was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues he encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and i started getting really stressed then when i had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep i stopped talking to him for a while after that he said things that confirmed what i thought people in my family were thinking abou me now the issue i am facing i do not feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that i had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt so now i just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up but the anger and hurt do not go away from what he said either it is been months and i just do not want to talk to or see him at all he is reaching out again and i cannot find the words to explain the anger and hurt i feel because i feel like i should not be angry or hurt so it is just a big spiral of anger and shame the worst part is i do not know of i can ever have the same relationship i had with him before we were buddies even if i get over this i just do not know if the trust will ever be back this makes me sad i did not really want him involved but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help is not wanted
1,i do not know what is wrong with me i have always had depression and in the past thought of suicide i got over the suicide idea mostly but now i am worried i might have something severe my dad brought up multiple sclerosis and it is worried me ever since i have a few symptoms of ms such as fatigue cognitive problems and muscle twitches all the other symptoms i do not really have and fatigue and cognitive problems can be from depression i believe well anyways i keep getting worried about it and i started getting scared anxiety and i cannot sleep then right when i just start sleeping my legs or arms twitch waking me up abruptly i would go see a doctor but i have no medical coverage and no job could this ms idea just be mental turning into a physical problem with my limbs moving right when i start falling asleep i do know when i start falling asleep i start dreaming then i suddenly move the limb i move in the dream but also i do not need to be almost asleep and my arm or leg will move slightly
0,best friend drifting away i have debated whether to post this or not for ages my best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times and i have been there for her we are similar in so many ways run a small blog together and i love her to bits on new years eve she was set up with a guy and they have been dating ever since since their first date we hardly talk she does not even want to talk about him much and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her they go out drinking a lot almost every night it seems like he spoils her and she is told me she is really happy but at the same time her anxiety is still bad she is lost her ambition to travel adventure and take up new hobbies she does not contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on our domain does not expire until july i feel like i have lost my best friend but i am mostly scared that she is already lost herself because of a guy and i just do not know what to do i have stopped chasing her for plans because she is always busy now we used to meet up weekly and stopped messaging because there will not be a reply she checks up on me every now and then and i have not been doing well at all but i do not want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing i just feel so clueless right now and i miss her any advice
0,only friend who consistently wants to hang out with mei have started liking him less and less help no names or genders here and i am not getting into specifics on events just in case i have one friend who consistently wants to hang out unlike my other friends but the problem is that over the last few years i have started liking them less and less they are fun to talk to and hang out with usually but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile they can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it an unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them i know a few for sure but who knows how many they have pissed off in the meantime so i either have to plan events without them and they get upset or not invite my other friends who dislike them we have known each other for years and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but i have gotten the distinct impression it is onesided but they have not done anything wrong to me that would really merit breaking up a friendship so i have kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though i would rather not and just forget they exist at one point i was one of very very few friends they had but i know they have a good consistent friend group now so i do not know advice please is it ok to just not want to be friends anymore even if the other person has not done anything wrong when i think about hanging out with them even though i know we would probably do something fun i just feel apprehensive and mildly annoyed
1,feeling nostalgic does anyone else obsess over a point of time in their life when they felt like they were truly happy for me the last time in my life when i felt like i was truly happy was and mostly the summers ever since then life has changed so much my depression got worse than ever i spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now does it ever get better again or what i keep telling myself this is just a stage and things will get good again but it just seems to get worse nostalgia can be a great feeling but killing me now knowing how good life once was

1,i even want to write this post i just wish i had the fulfilling family experience like everyone of my other friends did but instead i got a drug addict mom and a emotional incompetent dad who i regularly got into emotional skirmishes a lot when i was younger i am the product of verbal abuse and emotional neglect and it haunts to every single day of my life this affects me in ways like not being productive at all when i get close to deadlines not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up i have self destructive tendencies that i use as coping mechanisms i hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks i even know if any of this makes sense because of the conflicting thoughts always having about whether or not i believe or believe that this life is worth living trying every single day trying my hardest to keep it together trying my absolute fucking hardest to keep moving forward but i am consistently being stopped or held back by the dread and anguish of waking up to a life that i even want to fucking live

0,friends that be wrong so basically my friend always thinks that mad when not in turn he gets mad at me because i try to explain as calmly as possible that not mad which makes him even more mad why does he always convince himself that mad and refuse to understand that not even when i try to explain it how can i handle situations like this a cool dude and all but his mislead belief in thinking mad and refusing to accept that not mad in turn makes me mad so annoying
1,i am a year old married mother of three boys i was recently diagnosed as having depression i have noticed it getting a lot worse in just the past week at first i thought to myself i do not have anything to be depressed about but the more i thought about it the more i realized what it was me and my husband used to spend time with our kids and go out and do things on fridays or the weekends i cannot remember the last time we just went to walmart as a family for no reason other than to go my husband does not understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him his friend went i do not care if he is only going for an hour that is an hour we could have his time i cry all the time when he is not here just because i miss my husband i am we should have a healthy active life with our kids but instead i work and come home and on my days off i sit at home with my kids when he is off he stays at home he works and then him and his friend if they get off early go places in town and then he comes home i do not get to do that i cannot remember the last time i just went window shopping just running around my thoughts about not being around have gotten worse and that terrifies me how can i get my husband to understand that him spending time with me would help this so much he just thinks it is a joke and that is one reason i think he would not miss me if i am gone except he would have to find another maid

1,college medical withdrawal for a semester okay so i am thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression i have already contacted my academic advisor and the financial aid office but i honestly have no idea whether everything will work out or not if i manage to get a course load reduction does anyone have any ideas for things i can do to help myself get better during this semester if it ends up not working out does anyone know about other ways i can go about making this semester less stressful for background i have a scholarship for tuition for the next two years and i am terrified as fuck that i will lose that if i get a course load reduction also my parents basically do not know what mental health is so there is no way i can talk to them about it
0,hello world yes well umm i have just started this journal as you could probably tell and i am aiming to use it to record life as it is now for me as for most journals i have not put this online to show it off per say i am using blogger because it is very accessible and so i can come back to memories and thoughts that i might well have forgotten in years to come however comments and everything are very welcome i hope that i will be welcomed here well enough i am currently working on a layout of some kind that might come sooner or later we will have to wait and see well i suppose that first journal entries include a bit about the journaler so i will introduce myself shall i my name is jennifer but on the internet i go by the alias of myth i am currently and studying in grade at a school in brisbane australia i am more of a nerd than not i guess you can say but that is mainly because i need to study really hard to get where i want in life in terms of a career as i would like to become a physiotherapist but i am quite good at a variety of different things i can write stories and poetry draw to some extent and even defend myself as i learn a martial art called ju jitsu my parents are separated but i see them both equally so it is not that bad a deal and i have two brothers one twin brother and one half brother who is currently six he the latter is really cute but he is also terribly annoying and in m opinion a little spoilt i like to rp roleplay mainly the online kind so you can often find me in the rp sections of forums or mushing on sites like elendor but most of my time is lately spent in study or at ju jitsu training which is really very fun despite all the bruises well that is about all i can think of at the moment so i will be off and i will post sometime later i plan to try a very different style of journal writing so i will see what i can come up with

1,well it is been a year now since i tried killing myself a year ago on december i tried to kill myself i spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then the therapy has helped quite a bit i have slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time as far as meds go my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work mostly so i cannot complain too much i do not think i am ever going to overcome depression i have kind of learned to live with it sure but beating it probably will not happen i am way too cynical to beat it it is just how i am wired there is a lot in life i probably will not get to experience because of how i am and i still do not know how to change that or at least make some good out of it i guess what i am trying to say with this post is i am not sure if i am happy or not it is the not knowing that bugs me i know i am better than i was a year ago but i still feel lost and i do not know where to go from here every day is just a haze that i trot through sorry for the rambling have a good night

1,i am new to this forum and actually to the whole talking to people i do not know online thing i have been looking around a lot online to find somewhere i can talk but all the chat rooms and forums say they are about one thing and then you get inside and everythings about sex then i stumbled into this place i started reading postings and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people i have not struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that i am only but feel so old i am very very recently separated let us face it broken up with my exfiance we have dated for almost five years and have a son together who will be two on saturday he has not treated me the best never hit or anything physical like that just never around and he is really not what i want my husband or even the father of my children to act like he does have moments of goodness and this is what makes it so hard because why cannot he always act like that i know he is capable of it i told him we should separate but i know he is been thinking it for a long time he is been forcing things because of his family and because he feels respect and blah blah for me i stayed around because he is the father of my child and face it it is hard to find someone new when you are a woman and you already have a kid i love him very much and i guess i was just expecting him to wake up one day and say man i need to change or i am going to lose this great girl i wanted to separate because i think that is the only way he is going to realize how good of a girl i am and how good i am for him now i am scared though that he will never come to this realization or meet someone else he says he is not looking but let us face it he is a man he says he needs at least months to find himself it makes it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we are not together we probably see him more i have no family where i live and the last years have been devoted to my ex and son i have managed to lose contact with any friends i had and never made any new ones i am now completely alone except for my son which i feel like i cannot take good care of because i am always crying i am a high school teacher and i had to take a couple days off this week because i am so touchy and can cry if the wrong thought pops up in my head it is affecting every part of my life and it is so overwhelming i used to be afraid that if we ever split i would end up alone with only one son and no family now i am afraid that he will never come back i really just need someone to talk to
0,mri found benign mass and now radiologist suggests going back through mammogram and ultrasound why repeat tests that sent me to mri in the first place in old i had a sharp breast pain that never left no lump could be felt it just hurt i gave it a few months and no change i went to the dr who scheduled a mammogram and an ultrasound i received a letter in the mail shortly after informing me that i have extremely dense breasts and the results were inconclusive i figured my physician would let me know if needed anything else and i just moved on in my mom was diagnosed with stage cancer and got a lumpectomy and in a conversation she brought up the state mandated letters being sent because dense breast tissue can hide cancers uh oh i messed up i should have followed up so i make an appointment again with my provider pains the same so i get an mri with contrast the dr calls me hours after the mri which freaked me out the radiologists report says benign mass found in the painful breast and to get a mammogram and ultrasound why would i loop back around what makes it benign so many questions my physician also wanted more information and tried to reach the radiologist but he had left for the day so we wait in the meantime i am just trying to figure out why if benign as he stated i would need additional tests and also why would he want to repeat the mammogram especially any insight

1,in a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay been a week since i returned from a six month exchange program overseas there i ended a relationship with an addict who i still cared for but could not love anymore then of course i fell in love with someone we were inseparable for the six months as i struggle with depression anxiety and schizoaffective disorder it been the easiest for him we planned to end our relationship and continue as friends but just bear to at the departure gates we decided to try a long distance relationship but after a week had enough of me he has his own problems and we live hours apart with a time difference so i blame him at all i do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him i used to be really sociable but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people i still have friends but they either actually gaf or they have their own problems and i want to add on to their burdens also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward besides how much can friends be there for you you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end had terrible insomnia since coming home still on school break cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis and all the things i used to watchdo to cheer myself up music slam poetry writing youtube netflix games i have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits so anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad loved and lost many times and i know it gets better eventually but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and not sure what i can do to survive in the meantime in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back having been accumulated from all these problems he was the one person that made me feel like someone understood and was there in this big bad world and without him i feel like floating and nothing will make me feel okay again for a long time

0,how do i end this or can i fix it ok so it is kind of a long story but me and my best friend met in high school we clicked right away there was this bond and kind of still is between us we would never separate always talking etc still in highschool she cut me out of her life sudendly for a whole year i do not know why i continue trying to talk to her but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her we did not talk at all about that she just gave me a note saying why she did that wich honestly did not tell much except saying she has depression and did not know what she was doing she said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out years later we did not talk that much as before but were still really good friends then i started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because i did not agree with her opinion over an actor she would rage in games with everyone and stop talking now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life for like weeks then come back like nothing happen she would never tell me what is wrong if i tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again eventually i got tired and told her that we could not go on like this so i stoped talking to her months later i decided to give another shot what happen was exactly the same so i stoped talking again and i though it was for good we only talked when we were with all our friends etc then i learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide she actually tried it said her mom and was admited to an hospital i was heart broken thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment so i went to the hospital and we talk normally then after she got out we had a conversation face to face about her stoping doing all that to me she said she was going to try and promised me promised me that she would tell me when something was wrong or when she would like to be left alone so i did not worry as much and that she would talk to me if i ever said something wrong about her everything was going great amazing really i could tell she was better with her medicine and all but that only last months now she had a problem with a boy she likes or something pretended that everything was ok despited her answers said otherwise and started ignoring me i was mad and said some things never change and she responded to me saying she was a lost because i wrote a whole text to her saying i want to be her friend but that will only work as long as she is honest with me and stops pushing me away she wanst answered yet she also never said to me that she is sorry she hurts me even thoug i say that to her when i hurt her i feel like i am in a toxic relationship that i always find my way back in again is there a way to fix this or should i just give up for good
1,i am a year old woman living in florida with my husband i have been severely depressed for months and now looking back i can see that it actually started about a year and a half ago if only i could go back and warn myself like many of you i have been suffering depression since i was very young in fact i can remember being in first grade coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night of course back then it felt more like fear in grade i asked my mother if i was a manic depressive because i had read about it and i felt i had all the symptoms she scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way i love my mother and she has always been there for me i used to call her at in the morning crying and she would talk to me until i felt better however when i call her up today she still does not understand when i tell her i am depressed she thinks i need to get up and start doing things until i snap out of it i try to tell her i have bills screaming at me and i still cannot get out of the house to find work i think she is in denial now with all of the information i find on this site i think i may even be bipolar when i found the man i wanted to marry i warned him that i had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday he said he would stay by my side no matter what and he has unfortunately it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it when he tries to talk to me and cheer me up i say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices let me tell you when i am like this i do not back down either i usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while he gets mad too but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me then i feel like a real jerk i just started seeing a psychologist since i have not had a job since last august and it is clear that i do not know my way out of this i have only met with her once but i think i will like her she has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on wednesday she wants me to get hour of sunlight everyday minutes of exercise and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow i am a bit worried because i have not been able to do them because i just do not sleep right anymore it is and i have not slept yet i may fall asleep in a few hours only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap i have tried some medicines but they do not help have any of you had this problem what did you do

0,the divorce talk the wife and i have had a very empty and distant relationship over the last few years after a couple of very difficult circumstances in our lives we sought counseling several times which did not help at all so we resigned ourselves to being basically roommates for the sake of our children neither of us cheated btw or at least i did not we decided to talk last evening and alot came out we are ready to call it quits i knew the relationship was dead but thought we would eventually come around i love her and am committed to her she loves me but is not in love with me anymore i am scared of what this will do to our kids the oldest is very sensitive we decided to try a thing we are going give ourselves x months and set aside time every evening to really talk about the things that bother us the things that brought us to this situation what we fear for it kids what we want for our lives all of it while doing it best to acceptnot judge the other person we have not really spoken to each other like this since before the kids so this may help if this does not change the relationship we will decide whether we will separate or divorce i have not told her this but i will be considering the option of suicide since i feel it would be easier for the children to cope with my death than to give them any reason to believe it was in any way their fault
1,does anyone elses depression show itself as exhaustion i find as i get older that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive as soon as things start going downhill the unexplained tiredness hits and i become like a zombie i have no energy to do my normal daily tasks the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain i barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space the physical lethargy always comes handinhand with the brain fog forget trying to study forget going through the bills my brain cannot handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or netflix i am writing this because i am in it now in the fog and i am lagging behind in life does anyone else feel this way does anyone know how to get out
1,the last of us i just finished my second playthrough i am poor sue me bitch after the part with the cannibals ellie sat on a bench and did not talk much this in combination with when she says he tried to to joel after she kills david made me get a bit angry and sad then i thought about my female friends few as they may be and family and how if any ever hurt them in such a way especially my family well i think it is better if that is left unsaid had to pause the game for a min to cry i never thought i would be so depressed that a video game could make me cry and i have played a lot of games over trophies on psn only this one made me cry and in retrospect i now think i have come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression emotion and the appreciation of it sometimes i can look at someone there body language listen to them and feel there pain suffering and sadness i now appreciate the last of us life and other people more although i did feel more alone afterwards especially since i think it would be wonderful to find a girl that has a personality like ellies never had a gf had any physical romantic interaction with a girl or even been on a date i was when the game was released and will probably still be when part comes out so we have not dealin with no pedo shit in these christian suburbs it was definitely worth it just thought i would share that in the hopes that it would brighten someones day i love you all stay safe
0,labour leaders more often than not tell us how they will die in the party blair said that he was not born in to the party but he will die in it i now know that this is a very useful device for making people rule out the idea of ever leaving labour and it is a phrase that sounds good and it is one i have copied and used myself for dramatic effect but when it came to it when this war criminal leader decided to throw in his lot with george bush stayiong in the labour was not an option what should have been the most difficult decision i have ever had to make after years flogging my guts out for it leaving the labour party was not only an easy decision but essential how could anyone stay in a party that stains itself in the blood of thousands of iraqi civilians dropping cluster bombs on them against the will of the uk and international community against the un against the law and for george w bush rumsfeld cheney financial and war criminal one and all and with the tories berlusconi john howard and aznar we could not even be bothered to count the bodies if anyone stayed in the labour party after abu graihb i wonder what they joined the labour for in the first place if it was not for justice and for an ideal that may or may not be obtainable at least it was aspirational for humanity i cannot even begin to list the sheer number of crimes against people society and democracy that this labour party has been responsible for and every single member is to blame your money has paid for a montrous election winning machine that believes in privatisation war and inequality all the talk of saving the labour party from blair is to miss the point when a party becomes part of the problem it does not deserve to survive the dead children in iraq will never be brought back a new leader will not be able to lessen the personal pain i feel knowing that by helping to elect this labour government i also have blood on my hands the tories would never have got the votes in the commons to conduct such a filthy war only a labour party wilting at the feet of it is leader could have pulled this off i will never rejoin the labour party and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who justify slaughter in such an ignorant detatched manner my new pledge is that i will die outside the labour party

1,am i the only one who believes in fantasies and lies to cope with not killing myself i believe that one day the girl i like will like me back i believe that she will reconsider rejecting me and apologize to me and we can be in a relationship as more than good friends i believe that i will be prepared for my career when i leave college i believe that i will find an internship this summer and every summer after that i believe that i will impress employers with my fantastic resume i believe that i will make lots of good everlasting friends in college and that i will make even more friends at my workplace in the next three years the relationships with my high school friends will only strengthen and we will be a group for decades to come i believe all of the people i know now i believe that i will graduate in the next three years and that i will be able to get as in my classes to increase my gpa i believe i can graduate with honors i believe that i will have enough money saved to actually visit japan i believe all of these things because i know i am a failure at life and i know i am not built to survive and dwell in this world one day i will end my life just when my fantasies can no longer be maintained
0,grandmother asks for loan to estranged father then refuses to carry debt i am mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder lives as a squatter in the forest and works only parttime meanwhile i work in silicon valley his sister made a huge effort to contact me which i ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well eventually i relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays in february i received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job he has regular seasonal employment and employmentinsurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives i called my dad and he asked for a loan of i felt sorry for the guy so i wired him the money after further thought i feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment meanwhile my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if i was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes this is not realistic if i did go there i would fly rather than drive for hours i called her back and asked if she would assume her sons debt this saves me the stress of servicing the loan and i have no interest in lending money whatsoever since she has cash from selling her house she is easily able to do this now her son can pay her back she told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she is on social security i responded i am saving for retirement too i make the full contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably will not even exist when i am that is no way to talk to your grandmother i am going to hang up if you at which point i hungup the phone my instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three dad grandmother and the aunt who i should have just ignored any thoughts
1,fuck so my ex who i miss like a lot and who moved away because she hated me so much is apparently coming back next year and i just want to die i really just want to kill myself this summer or at least move away i do not think i can handle that i just do not want to live anymore it is killing me why does she have to come back why cannot she just let me be alone and forget that i ever was not aaaaahhhhhhhhh now i am going to have to look over my fucking shoulder every five seconds when i am in the hallways and just fuck me straight to hell if we end up having any classes together i cannot fucking stand myself so i know she cannot aaahhh i do not want to make her angry but i know just my presence in general will fuck i do not know i finally got people to forget about it and stop asking about what happened and i do not want it to start again i just wish i could forget everything or die i wish we could both forget and not know each other i think she would be a lot happier she used to say she was happy she knew me but now knowing me makes her absolutely miserable and i think she would be a lot happier overall if she never did i hope i die i cannot handle this well i do not want to i am so fucking pathetic i hope i die she does too so i should i am sooooo tired i just want to die i do not think i can stand seeing her face in the halls every day again i just cannot
1,now this stupid posting thing is screwed up i cannot do anything right got the old depressed suicide bug again it is funny because last night i read some articles i had written regarding death and suicide many about saving other depressed persons from killing themselves recognizing the pain that the survivors go through and not wanting it to happen to my family and then the thought rears its ugly head it would be so easy to let myself go go into that peaceful night waiting until my mom dies first soon natural causes and then doing it because i am a failure i cannot do anything else but fail at my job i used to write in a cave type place a place where my writings would be secure and it is going away that is how come i looked at my writings i had told my therapist that it seems sometimes i feel angry and selfish and that is one of the triggers that trigger the thoughts of suicide i have run out of visits covered by insurance i could pay for more but there is no need for visits i have almost stopped talking i feel like going home crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying at the cave web site the others do not like to hear about suicide so i have stopped writing there it is another site for depression type people no one goes there now i keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid and i feel guilty but the words and my thoughts are obsessed with death i can make the decisions about my mom and my kid but this halfway limbo concerning my states sucks i guess this is just venting my mom has at least another week to live
1,i do not know if doing this right but putting it down on paper gets it out of my head at least temporarily and i am dying inside i am trapped i feel so low unwelcome familiar thoughts in my head and nowhere to turn my two teenage kids in bed my bloke away at his kids for weekend i want to cry but cannot anymore do not want to bring anyone down with my feelings but so lonely at moment life has nothing new to offer me and it seems so easy to leave it all but how can i when i have two beautiful kids upstairs cannot do that to them and that is why i feel so low hate life always have feel comfortable in depression after a while and that is when i get to point of not caring who i hurt had several episodes through teens and adult life drink used to help unemployment let me be selfish being single mom meant i did not have to explain my feelings but this is first episode since been with partner of years he will not understand and i just dread tomorrow when he comes home just want to sleep and never wake up trapped angry i am trapped feel selfish for feeling this way and that makes me even angrier any parents out there understand what i mean
1,the thing that sucks is that i have no one left to talk to no ones willing to talk to me and listen to my bullshit and everyone that i have told ends up leaving me or call the cops or some shit no friends either just keeping the suicidal and depressing thoughts to myself waiting for me to blow and kill myself one day maybe i look forward to that day thinking face
0,awoke this morning to a text message from rob obviously sent before he went on his way to alton towers decided not to get up straightaway though a mistake in itself as when i did get up i had got a raging headache managed to get my car cleaned and dried just as it started to rain ah well at least it is looking better than it was btw the text is a little bit too risque to publish on here but it referred to the frolics of yesterday afternoon blushes got someone else coming to see the house later this afternoon a firsttime lady buyer apparently seems like the influx of londoners coming into the sticks has not ceased as this is the fourth so far i just find it weird really that there have been so many of them must not complain though if they are interested in buying the place found out today that helen is changing her car next week from the corsa to a people carrier type vehicle not sure what it is as yet but i will get to see it sooner or later dad is still in a mood over something or other does my head in

0,advice please i have been in a relationship with a woman for some time now and it has becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty she has a son from her previous marriage seven years old her previous husband however was very controlling and abusive her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result he constantly swears fuck shit cunt etc just to show how extreme he is violent a lot throwing things across the room he is constantly screaming and shouting no concept of manners he will shout give me food now his mother as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband is too scared to stand up to him he clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical he will often have breakdowns with fits of anger she lives with her parents while they have the best of intentions for their grandson her mothers treatment of her is vile she is cruel and demeaning she constantly undermines her confidence and authority saying she is stupid and does not know what she is doing in front of her son and then stupidly complains that she get her son to listen to her she regularly swears she loudly gossips about everybody complaining about with violent undertones and to make it worse she often threatens calling social services on her personally i doubt she would as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter but either way he would be taken from both of them so yeah a bit complicated no idea what to do as it has very likely that i will become a step father to this child i was wondering what advice people could give or direct me to somewhere that could help thanks

0,female reasoning why does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because each other for yearssince freshman etc i believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship but i do feel it is much harder for a male for several reasons men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop a mans and wants can easily blur the lines and when in the right environmentsetting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc i see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening do women honestly feel because of a long friendship ensures its innocence or just an excusereason given in an attempt to or have that friendship accepted by their significant other
1,do you ever zone out and feel like you are a thousand miles away or dreaming when people are talking do you ever feel for example watching people argue having a conversation or a situation playing out in front of you or a person talking to you and you feel like you are a thousand miles away in a happy place or you are watching the scene play out on tv or in a dream this started happening to me once ever months then once every then every month and now once a week it lasts seconds maximum but afterwards i feel calm and relaxed and as if i am not there anymore am i alive it is hard to explain

1,do people ever find their jobs interesting you have gone to school and studied and worked hard to get the job you have alway wanted is it as interesting as you hoped it would be before you got the job or was it just a waste of time because all i see online are people complaining that your dream job is not really what it seems and i wanted to know if life is just going to keep getting more depressing even if you get your dream job
1,heres my story however dull and blunt it may be high school was great lots of fun you know parties beer dates sports and the works i was never what one would call popular however i was respected by nearly everyone i went to school with this i feel was an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence as well as developing as a individual i am now in june and have no job no money do not go to school and have literally no friends aside from my parents whom i still live with a leach off of what a joke i am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarettes and to visit my grandmother who is well near her deathbed i suppose my past bout with drugs may be a co culprit influencing me to work in close to complete isolation maybe there is a cure for me but chances are it is not natural remedy my addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter this condition of mine whatever the fuck it is started developing slowly i would avoid large social gatherings at first then i would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friends even the closest of friends and finally i would not even take phone calls at this point it is all of the above when i do confront a person which by all means i try to avoid i cannot for the life of me keep eye contact like i used to and i seem like a complete uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat for instance a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things when asked what i was up to i looked at the ground and replied well i am pathetic excuse of a lie goes here nobody buys my shit if i do not believe myself how can anyone else so here i am today the table has turned i am now the chump the one without any respect or self respect and the guy who respects anyone who is not as lowly as myself and i hate myself for it it is not as if i had a rough upbringing my parents are and were loving i have had so many friends all the opportunities in the world and i waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life i am not looking for sympathy it actually matters little if nobody reads this at all i just needed to put my thoughts somewhere i could come back to re read and contemplate them
0,well i made it to graduation sort of after slipping by math with the scholarly final grade of a d minus i acted like chris farley in the begginning of tommy boy and felt that it was neccesary to brag about my accomplishments to every man woman and child within a mile radius well not really but i did call most of my close friends and family if you are reading this and wondering why i did not call you get over it commencement went well except for the part where i got the case with no diploma inside the weekend was great except for when i found out that i had to change my living arrangments because of someone backing out of a contract i will not name names but his initials are tim taylor no hard feelings tim only four more weeks of college and then i will become as close to democrat as possible so that i can freeload off of society and milk the government for all it is worth until i finally land a job at this point any chance of actually landing a journalism job seems about as realistic as bumping into tom hanks at merritt square mall i would say more like one in a million so you are telling me there is a chance dumb dumber speaking of merritt square the new theater there is amazing as my good bud stacey said the theaters motto should be cobb can you believe you are in merritt island we saw day after tommorow and it was not as bad as i thought it would be and they did not really push an agenda like all the media was saying they would that is truly a first well i have already typed way more than anyone would want to read so i will stop

1,lonely and stupid i feel so stupid i have always been academic and studious if anything i have dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge at the expense of forming human relationships but i am constantly overwhelmed by how much i do not know how slow i am to understand concepts and how my peers are all more intelligent than me i know it is impossible to always be the smartest person in the room but i feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts at the same time i have conflicting feelings over my loneliness i desire human interaction but others find me rigid and distant in all honesty i am easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions i understand that it is important in forming friendships but my understimulated brain seems to automatically shutoff after a while i have noticed that the people i do get along with are like me introverted cold and academic we do not see each other as people but as enlightened books with fresh concepts these ideas are interesting to explore if the book is lost we are disappointed but not crushed we were never bound by friendship we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation i do not feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances
1,i am new here today i believe i have been suffering from depression since i was a late teen i am now run my own business and just started prozac late december seeing a psychologist in late nov i do not feel any better but it is a relief just knowing that you are doing something other than trying to ignore a definite but unexplainable problem i suffer from severe anxiety fall asleep fine but wake up at am with my mind racing a million miles a minute mostly about work this anxiety and depression has definitely affected my relationship with my wife kids most times when you are at work you want to be home vice versa really do not know what you want i do not feel like talking to anyone have cut off most of my good friends i understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaves them and it is too late i am happy that is not the case with me i just hope the medication kicks in soon so i can see what it feels like to be normal if that is possible thanks for letting me ramble

0,my dad is dealing with anxietydepression hey i am years old and i still live with my parents recently it was been very hard for everyone of us my dad suffers from bad anxiety and most likely depression for the past weeks he got some panic attacks one leading to him calling the ambulance thinking he was getting a heart attack i know for a fact that this has been passed down to me to i also suffer from anxiety but i learned more to deal with it now but times like this it gets a little harder we lost our dog weeks ago and just a week after that my father lost his brother so its most likely that which is causing the high anxiety and depression it brings the whole family down and i am a bit worried about my father but i do not know what to do we have been talking about this and he is aware that he is suffering from anxiety but we all do to some extent i guess but he is in a bad place right now maybe i just wanted to get stuff out my chest any suggestions
1,hello i am a year old male this is my time joining this forum i joined once had to resign in because it moved form com to org or something then i took medicines was feeling better and kind of stopped coming here now i feel bad again i think this forum is a great resource the people who started it should be quite proud of themselves if i started something that touched this many people at the mindsets that were at maybe i would not be depressed anymore my complaint as i have mentioned i think it is wrong to make people post times they are allowed to create a thread when people are here feeling depressed sometimes i would assume suicidal they should be allowed to post new threads right away however i do not mean to complain as i do feel this is a great resource and it is more then i have done to help the less fortunate in the world good luck everyone

0,so we did the oklahoma thing it was actually a very beautiful lake on saturday as soon as we got into ok it started pouring we were worried that our funfilled weekend would be ruined because of the rain we had nothing to do we decided to see dodgeball which was silly when we came out of the movies the sun was out and the sky started to clear we dashed over to the lake to rent a kayak it was really nice and not too hot since it had been raining all day we then ate dinner at a local restaurant sundays weather was better my husband enjoyed the scuba diving though it was not my cup of tea i am not certified and just sat on the shore under the trees trying to avoid the sun i told him that i might not go with him the next time he decided to dive since it is not very interesting for me i know he enjoys it so much but is definitely not a spectator sport i am teaching classes in a summer program for high school students it is going well though some of the kids do not seem to care very much about the program they seem to be determined to get kicked out of the program which will provide college tuition upon successful completion i do not know hopefully these kids will wake up and realize that this is a unique opportunity before they are removed i know that they deal with difficult stuff at home things that i never had to deal with
0,i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest so i decided without conscious control or empirical decision making to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well to destroy them its not as if i am a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff just the pleasure of destroying their city so i went to the garage found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in along with a flaming book of matches and i threw a bible in just for good measure good kindling really nice thin pages anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me and the most satisfying part was that no ants came back out i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing but well the world is full of wierdos that do a lot more worse stuff so i am ok right

1,i willingly admit that i am a sufferer of depression but in my case i think the problem was education more than anything i recognize that i have been depressed pretty much from as far back as i can remember i am not sure where i got the misinformation but i spent most of my life believing that it was just me just life you know the thinking that some people were lucky and happy and i just was not i am now so it is a wonder that i made it to this point considering the statistics i think that i tried to destroy myself in other ways like smoking and minor drugs and not taking care of myself basically i was waiting for things to either get better or finish falling apart about a year ago my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of zoloft and some counseling which changed my life the problem then became that i changed jobs and lost my insurance with no hope of cobra so i actually went of the drug cold turkey highly not recommended believe me and am now back where i started have any of you found yourselves in this situation what do you do
1,i do not want to die but i have not keen on livin either sorry for the robbie lyric i just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and i go back to soldiering on alone i am sorry if this rambles or does not quite make sense but if i leave the stream of consciousness or reread i will probably delete because i loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well i have probably got it better than most people here but a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way as some small solace i am never particularly sad nor do i hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it however in every waking moment i have a weight emanating from my core like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful the best way i can put it is in the title i simply do not want to be and that is not because i am overwhelmed by hardship or struggle i have got it pretty good and there is nowhere i would rather be if hypothetically you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said alright you are about to be born ready to go i would say no thanks i am good with a core belief like that there is no life to live career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time and i would be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who does not want anything from life probably also is not worth being with and heaven forbid someone should want kids hey junior daddy does not like his existence but he had you anyway what an asshole i should stop before i become some combination of old man yells at cloud and whiny emo stereotype this stuff sits on me every day and i wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others was not there but it is so here i am

1,the world needs more lollipop moments back in middle school i was helping out at a sunday school tutoring primary kids there was this adorable little girl who was struggling to sing the right tunes of a hymn even though i have absolutely no musical background i tried to help her get her vocals and lyrics right by singing the hymn together eventually i told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last she would call me frequently just to sing her new hymns and i would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves fast forward to today i am currently a struggling undergrad students coping with depression and stress and well as deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue bad grades and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns many days i would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything and barely making it to lectures only to zone off at days i would think of suicide as well there was nobody i could turn to that i felt i could relate to or even understand me it was not until a few days ago i received an email from the girls mother the girl was unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to of her hearing however she was recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement that song that she performed was the very first hymn she struggled when i first came up to her knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream i stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life knowing that i had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girls life gave me the purpose to live even though i had to wait for years for this news it was worth it tldr we all have the ability to give small act of kindness which goes a long way from putting a smile on your face to giving away your coat to cover a pair of cold shoulders do not underestimate the impact it has to them in the present and the future what kind of lollipop moments do you have
1,when i was really young my sister who is like years older than me got me to constantly play these role playing games with her where she was the dominant one in the relationship it went on until i was in grade i think i do not know and the thing is i am not repulsed by her or anything i do not hate her i did not know at the time it was wrong but even though i do now i do not really know my feelings about it but i think it is one of the reasons i am depressed i have not been able to tell anyone about it not even my psychiatrist i wish i could but every time i get close i close up and get really anxious i wish i could get this off my chest i do not know if my mom knows or not we do not talk about anything and to add to this i think i might be gay and i do not know if it was because of this or not it it started when i was but i did not recognize it as homosexuality i have only been with two girls while in middle school but that is it i think some guys are cute and all but i just get really uncomfortable my psychiatrist thinks i have some repressed memory but i do not know what to do about it i always clog up whenever i want to tell someone something important i have this fear that they will not care or will tell someone else my family has a huge problem with that and i have known too many deceitful people to trust anyone so if you have any ideas to what i should do please tell me

1,we have been playing quake almost every night for a little while we play online against other players using xbox live and it is very cool most people are friendly we have made some friends and we find them and play with them one time i found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again well last night i encountered a group who had a feud going one kid was talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it i figured one game was a not a big deal but sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night i have this guy some slack and did not say anything but then later i got to play as part of the same team with him what a jerk he kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the points instead of me forget about the team winning this guy wanted all the points for himself and did not care about the team i had to set him straight and after the game i had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again after that i saw the other players and they were all nice it only takes one guy to ruin a great experience overall playing online with all these people and talking with them is great you just have to know when to cut someone loose eventually when many people report him as being a jerk he will be banned from the game oh well

0,ah what a tangled web we weave to say i am involved in some sort of bizarre love triangle would be overdoing it but in a sense maybe that is what it is in order to sort this out i should start from the beginning i was working in a rehab for brain injured adults when i met her she was a petite spunky girl recently arrived in the area from california some how or another she showed interest in me and begain inviting me places outside of work i did not really care i was a student supporting myself and dealing with roomate problems housing problems getting to class on time getting to work on time the whole in and out of survival but while i am not all that great at subtle hints she was aggressive enough for me to pick up on the fact that she liked me and so after a long night of drinking and a bit of passing out and unkowningly spooning her our relationship began it was cool did all the great things you during a new relationship trips to the beach visiting the family staying up late talking holding hands doggie style sex heh at some point irresponsible as we were there was an abortion i do not want to go into here how bad that affected me for her i can only imagine it was much worse experience but it was her request and i supported it i do know having to walk through a thong of antiabortion assholes did not make it easy at all not to mention i wanted to choke the living hell out of a few of em time passed and the relationship seemed good then one day she told me she was moving back to california and wanted me to come after i graduated in a semester i was not too sure about this but i agreed she left afterwards i continued to go to school and doubt settled in perhaps i should break up with her next installment i move to california relationship ends we become friends and then the web grows more complicated

0,should i get a second opinion i recently found a lump in the upper outer quadrant of my breast i visited my normal doctor and he sent a request for me to get an ultrasound the report from the ultrasound says report multiple scans of the right breast with special attention to the clinical area of interest demonstrates a very echodense fibroglandular pattern there is no evidence of focal solid or cystic lesions summary no localizing findings i talked to my doctors nurse on the phone this morning and she said the only way they would take the lump out is through a cosmetic procedure which insurance would not cover i would not normally get a second opinion on anything but this months menstrual cramps were extremely painful and i usually do not get cramps should i go to a different doctor or possibly a gynecologist
0,was it wrong to block my dads phone was it wrong of me to block my dad we had a massive fight that just escalated quickly as we always do my dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry once i pointed out how hurtful it was and asked him to please not to say that but nothing changed so just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat he know that it bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later and then minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if i do a couple of things that he wanted sorry for being vague the things he wanted were the things i essentially want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about from my perspective i saw messages that were intentionally hurtful about how i family and then i saw a threat to shame me and then i saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted it was very late at night and i had work the next day that was the point i blocked his number and i told him before i blocked it and it is the first time ever in all years of my life however now wondering if it was the right thing to do because well asian parents always say shit like that and mean it and i think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot an imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well if they were overreacting about the disowning me part then i could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it the next two days i unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how i was sorry i had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about some of what they were unhappy about was not at all true but i think both my parents have now blocked my number yet i cannot blame them for doing that because i did it to them first but i do wish i had just turned off my mobile or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk instead of blocking my dad it is not possible to visit them as we live in different countries prior to this fight i have been working through issues with a therapist not hard to understand why my dad always says things like call me and come need a daughter like if i do what he says for as long as i can remember my parents do not know this thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life but undecided as i feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse violence lying and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage religion sexual identity and child custody would really appreciate some asian perspective here as most of my friends do not fully understand the cultural aspect of this
1,the toughest pill to swallow is that i care about the girl most i have lost all motivation for my academic life have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years my parents trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now i have lost all my bitcoin in a fire i was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago i will admit this one was getting to me quite a bit especially since i could have prevented it but you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression a girl a stupid uninteresting normal ass girl but i love her i love being around her and she probably does not even give a shit about me because she has a boyfriend we hung out at a park and had a great time we always do when we talk but she is never the one to start a conversation and never offers to hang out okay boyfriend but at least let me be your friend just planning a meetup is such a pain the ass i wish you would just tell me to fuck off but you keep saying yes all while you straight up do not give a shit about me hope is the worst part i am still clinging to my failing studies new random ass coins and this fucking girl i cannot even concentrate on the other two because i think of her all the time i am desperately trying to stay relevant to her in hopes i can catch her when she is available again and i feel like such a fucking creepy loser all for that small chance

1,dropping by to mention you should take some vitamin d supplements of course check with your doctor etc etc vitamin d is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in this is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often the best way to get vitamin d is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body vitamin d is best absorbed with calcium so if taking a supplement finding foods or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well you will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin d consumption make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen i may have butchered a lot of this vitamin d thing so please take the time to read this if you need anything message me

1,whenever i try to change my life these thoughts pop up had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life but i cannot shake the thought that says why bother why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life and on top of that i do not even know if i want a normal life i often think that the only thing that separates myself from the normal people in lack of a better word is that the normal people have an easier time fooling themselves a bigger capacity for selfdelucions and if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies i am not sure if that happiness is for me has anyone else struggled with these thoughts does anyone know how to motivate yourself to change when it seems so futile

1,hello everyone i am here because i am starting to have doubts about my mental health first off i am a year old male college student and up until about years ago i think i have been fine but lately i am not so sure for one thing i cannot seem to concentrate or focus on anything anymore and it is becoming very frustrating i find myself daydreaming or pacing only minutes after i sat down to do something important and because of it i cannot get anything done i cannot even focus on things that should be fun or the things i used to be dedicated too i have also become very philosophical i always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death the nature of existence etc but it seems like its becoming an obsession i always feel like i am wasting time but i cannot bring myself to do anything constructive sometimes i am disgusted when i realize how much time i spend simply pacing back and forth i also cannot fall asleep at night anymore i just lie awake thinking and i cannot make it stop i also have constant fears about becoming old and having regrets about how i lived and what i accomplished i also have constant regrets about the past it seems like there is nothing i can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy especially because for all the ambition i have i have no motivation whatsoever anymore also it is hard to explain but i get the feeling that i cannot feel life if that makes any sense it is like time is moving so fast that i cannot even realize it anyway i was never like this before and i have no reason to be like this now i do not have relationship problems or family problems and i am not religious this all just came out of nowhere with no apparent because basically it has come to the point where i know something is wrong with me but i do not know what i have kept telling myself this is nothing but its getting more intense and now i feel like i am spiraling into a void or something i guess i am simply here to seek some opinions on what my problem could be thanks a lot for taking the time ps i may have posted this in the wrong place but its my first post so i am not sure
0,it is the middle of summer and i cannot sleep i have not talk to my friends in a while i wonder what they been up to anyways i have leaned something this summer about me one thing being why i feel depressed and why i get irritate easily i have discovered that when i am not with a crowd of people i do not feel depressed or get irritate easily which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like year olds

0,i feel lonely and scared i will end up friendless need an ear i have come to the realization that i am really scared i will end up with no friends i used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years but i have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend i had in high school the new ones i made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group since sophomore year i am a semester junior but every friend group has their faults and with this one i do not feel like i fit in completely out of the of them are knowitalls who will try to correct you on every little thing like one time i was exaggerating and saying somewhere had more people and one of them came out of their room and said um i think it is actually more people those are also really uptight do not get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they are always trying to school me on what is appropriate mind you i never joke about race or oppressed groups or anything off limits like that i just do not always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected there is also one i do not even like that much no matter how much i have tried because she has an arrogant selfaggrandizing mywayorhighway attitude the point is i do not always feel in sync with them even the ones i do feel in sync with i do not feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as i reach out them when we are not in school and i do not like onesided friendships i am worried we will not stay friends after undergrad also this year of them are graduating and i have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot thatll be in my room i will admit i did not make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it is harder to make friends now with the people at my school i do not know what to do part of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place and trying to join this friend group when it was already established they eventually came to see me as a member and we have had good times but i do not know that these are my people and part of me wants to get a single room next year but i feel like i will just be jumpstarting my social isolation and i am also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics tldr i have lost touchoutgrown my high school friends do not fit in with my college friends and am scared to end up alone without any friends need advice

1,my name is maria i am and have social anxiety plus some traits of borderline personality disorder i have been taking prozac for the last eight years and have been seeing a psychiatrist that whole time next week i have an appointment with a therapist i have only had random therapy sessions during this time what i am really struggling with right now is how i am still single after all these years i will go out with someone about a half a dozen times and then they lose interest or as the last person said i freaked him out really i think he overreacted to a couple of incidents but i guess if he was freaked out who am i to argue in my best friend ex died in my condo from years of drug alcohol abuse he was going through a rough period at the time but i really think we would have ended up together since then i have had a hard time connecting with anyone else on the same level does anyone else find that people they date are scared off every time someone breaks it off with me i get very discouraged and that much more jaded with this last person i even took a day off from work anyone else go through this
1,you know what i realised i cannot really get to sleep at all and have been doing alot of thinking i just realised that i am in control the thought of this makes me really happy i am smiling ear to ear i do not know i am just feeling really fucking good and decided to type about it as soon as i wake up i am going to destroy this fucking day also as soon as i get back to college i am going to tell this one girl that i like her fuck yeah
0,it is not like i do not want to hangout with them i think i am becoming a bit antisocial so i just got a job and my days off are always all over the place when i finally do get a day off my friends instantly call me up and ask if i want to hang out the thing is i just want to relax so i always either say no to them or make up some excuse it is not like i do not want to hangout with them but fuck sake i am tired and i want to enjoy my day off on my own and that is probably not the best thing i think it is me developing an antisocial attitude
1,i had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today i am getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who do not want to go to a therapist she let us me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health like what our rules for jeffrey and food are last time she gave me a series of homeopathic remedies undas to support my liver this time it was a capsule called ichol i am not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet but i am willing to try them for now i do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help i am willing to go for it for a while i have been searching the net reading about katirina and other personal tragedies that bloggers are going through and i am sort of jealous my life is just full of normal stuff right now my grandpa died in august and we went to his funeral but it does not affect my life in a large way just in the morally rehensible way that now i do not have to feel guilty about not going to see him it is not that i did not want to see him i just never found the time and now i do not have to worry about it at some level i am sure that means that i am headed to eternal damnation in other news we have managed to find a geocache it took us three trips to the spot because dusk is not the time to find dark colored boxes hidden in an unlit forest even if it is just kilometers southwest of our house on a really nice nature trail

0,ever notice how the end of the school year is both exhilarating and a real let down i spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers writers and people yet only some of this shows through your high achievers get better some of your middle achievers improve and a lot of students just stay the same behavior is at an all time low at this point too since my fifth graders do not have finals thyeve been tuning me out for the last three weeks it is terrible although there is little i can do about it i just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that i taught remain with them maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run who knows anyway it has been a long year and i am ready for it to end thank god it ends next week

1,i am a year old mother of two ages and i guess i have been depressed about everything more recently but have been really depressed for about years now i thought bringing a new child into my life years ago would help but it only increased i am so lonely with no friends well one since i moved to upper new york years ago from pittsburgh pennsylvania i love my children and my hour job that my doctor suggested however i do get to talk chat with anyone i get every morning thinking that this day will be better but it turns out to be sometimes worst than the day before i guess i am writing this to gain some friends and feel that i am not alone in this situations i feel i am into i do not drink i do not do drugs and i take my prescribed medications like i am suppose too is there anyone out there that would like to talk or write or email me

0,yesterday when i was browsing i found this link how i cannot even remember i was looking for something totally different i started reading some of the blogs and since i have been so lonely lately i decided to try to write some of things that come to my mind one of the things that i can start talking about is how my life has change from last year now i am single again i got a divorce i cannot say all the fault was his but mostly yes he cheated on me i think the hardest part has past now i need to look forward and try not to think about what if i did everything possible to save my marriage because i have a little daugther and i wanted her to have a family forever the same way i did when i was single the first time i am so lucky to have the parents i have and the sisters i have now i appreciate all the efforts that both my parents did to keep us all together and happy today is the birthday of one of my sisters by the way so the point is that all the perspectives i had about life changed with this tragic episode in my life really everything i believed before is kind of gone i just hope that divorce is not the same for everyone because mine has been hard mostly probably because of the relegion beliefs i had i said i had because now everything looks so different i am so happy for all the people that has found love true love now i realize that having someone to share your time and ideas is one of the most imnportant things we can have more than money of course money always helps sometimes i think if i will be able to trust again you know as a partner and find someone that i can count on someone to grow old and have wonderful memories do you think is there such a person for me last night i was thinking about all the relationships i have had in my life and always end up the same way men cheating or maybe is me being to naive i am liseting rod stewart an old song i like to liseting the oldies well i am not that young i am although i do not feel so old i like to exercise and do a lot of things with my daugther and her friends i guess most of the tv shows i know are from disney channel an about movies well most of the movies for kids i have had so many challenges in my life but definetely this one is one of the hardest to pass i will let you know how i am doing later

0,i am just confused what i should do or how i should act asianparent issues my dad a man i dearly respect for his achievements and the hard work he does for my family treats me like shit in comparison to my twin brother often seeing my dad trying to be cheerful when talking to my brother and transitioning to his normal angry and grumpy self towards me i cannot help to be jealous in terms of general achievements my brother and i are leveled equally but my brother is self centered and like an ass hole to my dad remembering a event few days ago my dad asked him to come to a restaurant with the family but refused to go reasoning that he did not believe in family ties and emotions only to be found playing with his online buddies when walking inthis happens most week even then my dad tried his best to be cheerful towards him after dinner while i just got his tired grumpy looks i am honestly thinking of just being a huge dick to my dad now and appeasing the retarded filial piety in my family any thoughts
0,hot and cold friend i do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time some of them have developed into stronger friendships we bond on more than just gaming i became close with one guy in particular and i would say he is become one of my best friends we met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and i am initially we texted all the time but i have been noticing very recently his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent i get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but i feel like things have changed i had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate always asking about my day initiating conversations and just being a kind friend in general if it is been a couple of hours and i have not replied he would message me to check up i admit it was a bit intense at first but i had gotten used to it and reciprocated but now that he is kind of dropped off i feel like i am becoming overbearing and that is the last thing i want to be i feel like i am putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days i have brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just am not what they used to be on top of that i am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me i do not nearly game as much as he does so when i do come online we usually play games together sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more we game with each other we do not really play in groups much because he is a bit of an introvert and does not feel comfortable in large group settings the other day i was invited to play with a friend we made online prior to this my friend and i had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early but me not wanting to play with our new friend alone i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so i was happy by the time i called it a night and found that all of them were bonding these incidents have happened a handful of times in the past month and it is left me slightly annoyed and very confused

1,anyone else feel they are unloveable tldr i feel i have no friends and anybody i get close to leaves i started noticing i was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school i understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school i just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school i got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help i confided in my best friends at the time and almost immediately i noticed of them stopped talking to me the third still friends with but not nearly as close as i used to be when i went to college my roommate and i became best friends but a year later he decided to drop out and leave i realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend finally my year of college i met the most amazing woman with her help i felt like i finally defeated depression we dated for years and i was so sure we were going to last however i got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast we decided we could last through the distance so i took the job and moved miles away she just told me it working out and broke up with me she was my best friend and my girlfriend for years i never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as i did for her now fearing my depression may have come back thinking i defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support here on the east coast of the us and i have no friends or family around me i know what to do and everyday i just feel like me vs the whole world already lost all hope and i feel like i deserve happiness why else would happiness be ripped from me every time i feel like i found it sorry for the long post i just know where else to turn to

1,what are ways to connect to a close person who is depressed been dating a girl for months and notice her cycle of moving close to me then pushing me away she gets secluded and almost checked her self into a hospital last month but she has never really opened up about the complex feelings so wondering how can help relate how can get her to know here to listen and attempt to understand i tell her often how special she is to me i get her flowers at her doorstep i show the love but recently trying to connect a different way she is currently pushing me away again so i asked to take her out to dinner the tomorrow no response i give up on her but i want to make sure the next moves are in the right direction i want to walk by her side thru this journey i give up on her either so any insight on how to be a good friend during a depressed state of mind would be amazing thank you
0,help with friendsroommate situation i have been trying to be friends with my roommate for months but recently noticed she uses me i always invite her to hang out i do all the cleaning i bake her food do sweet things helped her when she is throwing up taken care of her and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others she is never once said thank you or has reciprocated and my mother and a friend called it into my attention i was fine with it sort of but i really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends but like i said its fine you cannot force people to care back my problem arose when i introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road i was very familiar with and did not want her to go through and she proceeded to steal my bestest friends i only say the world steal because she does not try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group i am just so angry and cannot talk to her she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now and has just kind of shoved me to a curb i find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because i was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up and she knew i was lonely and super super happy when i made my supposed close friends she is so fake with them it does not make sense for example one of my friends was going through a rough time and i was helping him get through it and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once yes reader you are probably thinking to yourself what is wrong with wanting to help people and i would agree with you there is not anything wrong but the thing is that she lacks consistency she only tries to help when it is beneficial to her helping people is not in her personality i spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye why care about my friend who i had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with she literally had met him like twice i think i forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she did not have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex sounds sketchy af to me point is i have not talked to her in two weeks i just cannot hang with my friends anymore and everyone thinks i am the bad guy i myself do not know if i am the bad guy my close friends from home think i have a right to be upset am i the bad guy for being upset what should i even do at this point some people told me i needed to find better friends since they do not take my feelings into consideration but i do not want to be that bitch that is like you have to choose friends i am conflicted with that because loyalty in friendship is very important idk please help i am just so sad and mad
1,well i guess i mean i know i need help i lost my husband he died of a heart attack at on his walk home from a police station from being arrested for soliciting a prostitute two years ago cannot get over it it was a bad scene we were not great lovers or anything like that more like companions he cheated on me a lot and i just accepted it but we did things together ate out a lot went to flea markets he was nice to me he loved me he was just stupid and i would not have sex with him because of his indiscretion i think he understood that after he died about months or so i started going to a psychiatrist he put me on lots of medications it cost a lot of money i was still depressed somewhat and really i do not think he understood me at all so about months ago i quit everything medications therapy etc i have a year old son that lives with me and causes me a lot of grief he has diabetes really bad and no job two days ago he was lethargic and his blood sugar was i had to take him to the er and i know it has going to cost me thousands of dollars i have no extra money but what does a person do i tried to get him to get a job and it just turns into a yelling crying i am going to through you out of the house thing he is my child i will not throw him out oh he also has adult add i have a real hard time socializing because i have low self esteem i am fat years old not very attractive and on and on when i try to improve myself i get frustrated the weight etc i think about suicide but that is stupid i never act on anything like that it has just a passing though time to time i cry a lot i am alone a lot all messed up huh
0,what is the relationship supposed to be like between a year old uni student who lives at home with his mom and his mom
1,my first real episode hey guys i just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that i have not shared with anyone close to me i feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness so to start everything off i never thought that i would be typing these words as i am now not to say that i am ashamed of it but just because i never felt i had anyone to share with i never have felt like i was able to confide in my close friends or family because i do not want them to carry the burden of my troubles and i used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how i feel sometimes with that being said i feel as if i truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that i cannot really describe the feeling because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness i felt as if i was experiencing an out of body sensation and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmthlike feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head it is been happening a lot lately during the night especially since i have been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what i try eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit what really helps is interaction with others whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that i lose when my mind is left alone to itself i know it sounds stupid but lately i have just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from stranger things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when i envision the feelings as something physical i just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal pointissue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me

1,doing things that i like reminds me why i do not enjoy doing them anymore playing your favorite game you should not remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly when nothing else mattered but your game finished reading a cool book are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again do not forget your friends why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude faking a positive attitude is worse if you are going to be yourself just stay home oh you got selected for a great job opportunity wait until they realize you are garbage at your job you have time to relax now think again there is always someone needing something or things that need to be done trying to treat yourself wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time you are actually being responsible and starting work early wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore why does it matter to do things you like if you are just going to feel bad anyways i have been conditioned to believe these things since i started college and i feel stuck i am trying to deny that i believe in these things but the thoughts keep coming back i know that i should take care of myself but i am so tired of living that i am hesitant to do anything for myself

1,i had a date on saturday it went great unfortunately i have a friend that i will call h i have known her for years now and i really like her as a person i recently discovered that she was interested in dating me which boosted my self confidence so much because who would be into someone like me well a week ago i worked up the courage to ask her out on a date and this saturday we went on one it was great we went to a small local coffee shop and sat there and just talked for almost hours it was seriously such a good time on the way out i asked if she would like to do it again and she said yes awesome later that night i get a text she does not think it will work out in the long run i ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future she is still getting over another break up etc well that sucks but i understand i was texting h about it a bit more tonight and this is what i get in reply to how i feel about the whole situation i feel like there were so many expectations from others that it was made into something i thought i wanted but then i realized it that attraction she had to me it was not real it was all made up because of her friends and of course it was because who would be into someone like me it hurts so bad i am crying while typing this i feel like such an idiot for believing someone would actually be attracted to me i am a fool for believing it and i hate myself for it i do not know what to do i thought maybe it would help posting here or something i do not know

0,i know that i am not alone in the loving the wrong man line how many of us look for love in all the wrong places how many of us confide in our best friends or our mothers gasp that the man who is most important to us is unfortunately attached to someone else how many of us intend for these things to happen probably none of us we just seem to have a penchant for something that does not belong to us and then i have to ask does anyone really belong to anyone but themselves should not we belong to ourselves should not we do as we see fit no probably not because we harm others when we do this actually we harm ourselves our psyches our very souls we show ourselves to be without value we are unimportant we do not count and we do this to ourselves do we want to hurt others no i do not think that most of us even have any guilt about what we are doing the man certainly does not i seem doomed to be someones midlife crisis and no i am not that young i am years old and once again in the throes of a relationship that can only damage everyone involved he wants my address so that he can send me things he actually called me once from his home i asked him if he was out of his fucking mind i do not know why i am doing this because he smells so wonderfully fine and he tastes so good because he kisses like kenny gs music sounds because everyone i want seems to be married or gay yes folks the guy that did my eyebrow piercing is a definite hottie and has two grown kids and an exwife and is definitely uncloseted and he twinkles and flirts and makes you want to well i do not know lick him or something sometimes i hate men this one tells me that i am his whiskey lullaby i am not sure if that is a compliment or not i love the song but it is rather depressing and i could not help but ask if i was the bottle or the trigger i guess it is supposed to be a compliment listen to me piss and moan if you do not like the heat get out of the kitchen
1,if you do not want periods or pms at all there is the monthly injection depoprovera in the uk it does not work the same for everyone like all medicines but for me it stopped all periods and kept my depression down to such a level that i could function normally i stopped having the week mood swings week misery week mood swings week ok cycle if that is not an option for you there is a herb supplement that i tried called agnus castus it seems to have beneficial effects for most womens problems from aching breasts to full blown menopause and it can have the side effect of weight loss not a bad thing for me i was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when i came off it and had a period again i had completely forgotten what they were really like and things have wings now the pms did not because my depression but it certainly did not help it hope this is helpful
1,i have just registered and thought i would introduce myself i posted this in a different place but thought i would put it here too i hope that is ok i am chris female age i was diagnosed with depression years ago following the sudden death of my best friend i was doing ok and learning to live with it when my son my only child was killed by a drunk driver on christmas eve my world has collapsed i was of work for months but eventually returned there part time and have been coping in my own way until the turn of the year when i had another breakdown i am still off and isolating i do not open the curtains do not answer the door or the phone some days i cannot see an end to it to top that my partner left around the same time because he said he could not live with my depression any more i cannot say i blame him i would not live with me either given the choice i joined because it seems like a very supportive place and i noticed you have a forum for grief which i think i could benefit from if allowed access i sometimes think i am going mad without my son and noone understands the way it is for me hopefully i will meet some of you soon take care all

1,is it better to find out your love was a lie or never to have loved at all last year after years of marriage my wife says she never loved me has never found me attractive who can blame her and does not think we have ever been right for each other she only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married and i was a good guy as she puts it this crushed me she has been everything to me i have always loved her so much my whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me it was everything i wanted this was the girl of my dreams i remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl especially one as amazing as my wife would ever like me since i am shy boring and ugly i guess i was right it was too good to be true and i should have trusted my gut and known it back then after a year of trying to find ways to connect with her make myself more attractive to her and hoping she would love me i have finally accepted that she never will we are staying together for the kids sake and really for mine what else would i do no one else could ever love me and i doubt i could ever really love anyone else the way i loved my wife i have accepted that i will never have love it makes me wonder is it better to have thought i had love and enjoyed it only to find out it was lie or never to have loved at all at this point i really do not know

0,not invited to my friends wedding is it time to abandon ship a guy i have been close friends with for the last years is getting married this year and i have come to the realisation that i am not invited to the wedding to be honest we are not as close as we used to be we used to hang out all time but as lives became busy we spent less time together i still attend almost all of his social gatherings though that is probably only to times a year the weird thing is i was invited to his engagement party i got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me yet they did not invite me the wedding when i was slightly intoxicated at another friends girls night some time ago i asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because i could not remember receiving mine we then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and i realised i was never getting my invite i tried to act as if i was not offended and that i understood but honestly i am really hurt i have been invited to the hens night which is in a month it is not a cheap night upwards of for accommodation games etc it feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hens night when they would not even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding but i also realise that if i do not go to the hens it could come across that i do not value the friendship enough to go what should i do

1,i think for me some of the major issues affecting my depression are happiness motivation and isolation i am not really sure which came first but i voted motivation as i do not seem to have any i cannot remember the last time i truly felt happy either i think it was probably about or years ago when i was in college had a great social life and thought i was with a great guy socially i find it very difficult to stay in touch with people because i am paranoid that they do not really want to hear from me i lost touch with friends when i moved to college and then lost friends when i moved back to my home town now i have very few friends and feel the ones i do have do not really care too much about me i hate sounding like i am feeling sorry for myself but it is hard to explain

1,my depression is an excuse i help but feel like my depression and suicidal thoughts are just an excuse to be lazy and not try in life
1,i was sexually physically and emotionally abused by my father my uncle and my grandparents from the time i was five until i was fifteen my mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father since i was only five and not old enough to know anything none of them were punished for it and i had to keep seeing them on visitations until i was sixteen i am still sixteen and i told my dad i did not want to see him anymore this obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does i get upset all over again just when i had started to seem to get better i really wanted to write a book about my life but i figured that because my dad and his family was not punished or proven guilty that i would be sued for it i want to change my last name and then get a pen name but my mom says i have to wait until i am eighteen i do not exactly want to wait that long to write my book but i feel like i do not have a choice i have considered taking them back to court but i figured it is probably hopeless and i feel guilty and doubtful even though i know it happened anyways i do not want to put my mom through all that again a lot of times i think that i imagined it all and deny it because i wish it did not happen i really want to be a writer and to help people who have been abused but without proving my abusers guilty i feel as if this is impossible that it is not my right i am scared they would be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court what should i do i know everyone here is having a hard time and i really do not mean to be a bother i feel guilty just talking about it because there are so many others who have had the same thing happen to them but i really needed advice

0,classmate bullying problems i have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates seems like she feels as if she is superior the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says if someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them she is being very rude and insulting her voice is always extremely loud and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do for example she was upset with a group of her classmates because they did not want to follow whatever she says and she heard that they might have said something bad about her but instead of approaching them to ask them about it if its true or whatsoever everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about fake people as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty i do not get why she does it and why she is the way she is does anyone have an idea and what should we do about it it is getting annoying and i know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses does anyone have any advice by the way including teachers or some other people does not help either so any other advices or info to she would light on this is welcome thank you

0,i am starting to really see and respect the work that i perform as a mother to my son why cannot others see raising and taking care of children as a job no we do not get paid for it we damn well should and there is no equipment to use or an office or shop to go to but taking care of children is definitely a large responsibility especially if you choose to exclusively breastfeed for months does he respect me as a mother as a person he is involved with and as a woman at this moment on this day i truly question if the answer is yes
1,my twenty year old sister died instantly in a car accident in march of it has been almost a year and i have never had a dream about her until tonight in the dream she goes from one family member to another asking why we are ignoring her she is extremely upset and screaming that she does not understand she sees me starts toward me and then i wake up the overall sensation of the dream is that she stayed behind to take care of her fifteen month old daughter and to give birth to the son she was pregnant with when she died the strongest thing i picked up from the dream was the sensation that she does not know she is dead is there any meaning behind this dream am i losing my mind
1,i am mark this is my first post on here i am feeling really scared of myself at the moment i have been depressed to some extent for as long as i can remember and have had many hospital admissions in the past but for the past few years life has been manageable i have been in a relationship not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe i stopped overdosing and cutting the relationship as i said had its downsides i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it was a strong feeling whatever it was and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had was stronger than anything i had before i am so lonely and have very scary thoughts you see my partner has moved back to his home country as he had no choice he was living here illegally the days we were together before he left i started to have very disturbing thoughts i even thought of killing him as it would be easier than living without him that is very scary now that he is gone all the old feelings i used to have about myself and the hatred i have for myself is showing again he was my protector my distraction i suppose but now i do not have that i feel it is only a matter of time until i do some thing really stupid i have not acted yet as i do not what to have a failed attempt i am not sure i want help that is why i am looking here first maybe after this rant i will understand what is happening a bit more maybe not all i know at this point is i would rather not be alive not sure i want to kill myself but i do not want to be alive do not know if that makes sense
0,i lost my closest so recently one of my biggest fears came true i have many friends and because i always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me so i only had like two or three friends for this reason then i was diagnosed with depression so i tried to tell my best friend at the time that i had depression and that over the last year or so that may be why i had done some weird drastic things in this time i never did anything to harm my friend emotionally or physically while i was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me i was a shit person a shit father and a shit boyfriend that was months ago so i stopped talking to them because of that i tried going to my closest friend about something i never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away then i sought out help and i started to recover from the issue the and i made regular updates about on facebook because i was finally ready to talk about my issue but one day when i said i lost a friend him and the other person i thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because i made a side comment about what happened between us i never mentioned names i tried to move on with my life but they were the only friends i really had and i so completely distraught because i know what to do or honestly really how to make new friends i feel like now since it has finally happened to me i can deal with people who i thought were friends turning their backs on me but i just know how to make friends can i get some advice on what to do also a year old guy with a baby and a happy relationship do i even need friends

1,i feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people seek out professional help i know much about other cultures but i live in a hispanicamerican household i feel families are typically a very work focused group they expect you to just tough it out and push through everything most people in these communities see depression as an illness but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated almost a macho type mindset that you supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because been chronically depressed for years but finally going to seek professional help monday been having suicidal tendencies for years and if i ever have kids which i very much hope i do one day be damned if they feel they come to me to talk about any bad thoughts

1,it goes by a few names a spiritual eclipse the black hole the shadow my own prison the downward spiral i have named it a lot of different things like it has a life of its own in a way it does my life for too long and too completely it is getting better but at times it seemed it could not be much worse unless i did the unthinkable at least most of the time it is unthinkable divorced for a little over a year know removed from a wife i came to realize was a classic borderline personality look it up i never realized how far down i was on the ladder of life and spirit until i got away from the witch queen a true chameleon who changed and kept me guessing and off balance for years never knowing who to expect finally starting to figure it out i think two dwis since the split in rapid succession and then finding out i was self medicating without realizing it no license for the last months to go and recovering emotionally and financially with mom and dad thank god someone cares two children i had to leave with the queen of misery because of the threat of false allegations against me if i dared to go for custody hungry and lonely for someone to just be nice to me and care about me at least a little bit i find myself in my own prison having to acknowledge the fact why would anyone want to have anything to do with me hard to accept but the truth too much baggage my exs baggage she handed off to me to spare herself her own truth at times i wished i could just flip a switch and just go away times i thought about driving into a bridge abutment or into a truck at the last second absolutely crazy stuff i can now see what was so logical at that time to be so desperate from too much pain suffered by the abuser she was i can now see the so called glimmer or hint of a silver lining in the most simple of things life offers to everyone each and everyday thank god finally things will get better and hopefully someday great i keep trying remind myself things could be a lot worse two great healthy kids who love me and miss me terribly i am their entire world i now realize that that alone has kept me here realizing now that i have been lost in that vortex of hell tugging at me for years i actually want to keep going on to lifes next challenge that spells hope and progress in itself i have made it this far after going through hell with her why stop know when things are just starting to look up i do not want to go back into that dark hole that life was for far too long

0,so yesterday i was going though my old bookmarks and then i found the one that was my boyfiends from right before we met till a short time after a few days then he said he removed it since he never had time to post and it was all about his ex anyway so i clicked the little book mark and what do i see but a bunch of horable things about me and i admit i am a bitch but i have been really great as far as moods and that shit latly so what is the deal right the past few months i have been cooking at least two dinners a night do laundry for some dishes he does seem to help with that on and off then i get to fold and find a place for all the laundry hope like hell i get time to eat dinner and go to bed way to late and get up way to early to start the day with most the time all kids fighting not getting ready and still trying to get everyone out the door before we drop off a few kids here and a few there then i go to work for hours doing what you might ask well fucking housekeeping what fun right so everyday this is my day and sometimes i have to go to the store and pick up more food for a bunch of ppl that do not care if i cook i guess cuz they do not always rather hardly ever eat what i make so what i mean by two faced i mean why would i do all this for more then me and my own kids if i did not think he loved me i thought so untill i read what i read and that is not the first time he has been known to talk all that shit about me so what am i doing i ask self what the hell are you doing this is looking like a realationship of convienence and not of love or even lust or any of the good stuff at least that is how i am starting to get the feelings from him i am just here ruining his life for him everything is my fault geting old friends it really is and that is all i have to say about that on a lighter side my youngest offspring cut all her hair off on her own last night she said she was fixing her bangs guess she was going for that bangs all around look
0,i awoke this morning in a foul mood why i do not really know i had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day one thing i do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day which is not really surprising as once i get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred i have been at work for the last hours and have thus far accomplished nothing at least a lot more nothing then what i usually accomplish while at work in recent times i have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where i being of the opposite sex feel out of place i work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years my official job title is computer support assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since i started gainful employment here yet now feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined in the near future for a pay rise just to stick the knife in a little deeper you could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a web developer yet i as a lowly old computer support assistant should technically be paid less yet it appears that i have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years yet i still kick the shit when ever someone is in technically we should be on an equal playing field yet this too seem to be the case because i have been here the longest i am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh but alas it is not to be i must suffer in silence i know not been very silent i do however feel much better now after this little venture perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing i feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work

1,when i am lying in my bed i think about life and i think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me nowhere fast the smiths this is me in one sentence nothing matters i literally could not give a shit if i live or die what does it matter we are just a tiny flash on a rock flying through space we do not mean shit i do not mean shit life does not mean jack fucking shit i am not even sad i am just totally numb happiness sadness does not exist love hate does not exist reason meaning does not exist we waste our short time on this world then we die that is it so why should i give a shit either way i could kill myself right now would it change anything not really i could go and get help meds and stuff and i could probably be happy if i tried hard enough would it change anything not really when nothing has any meaning then why should i do anything i do not particularly want to die but i see no reason to waste even more effort trying to live it is a weird situation but like i said before i literally could not give a shit

0,having troubles reconnecting with an old friend aloha reddit so i am a guy and i am trying to reconnect with an old female friend of mine long story short she stopped talking to me and then i stopped talking to her but she thought i was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school recently i texted her saying that i apologize she said that she would give me a second chance so i start texting her questions to get to know her again but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer all she says is yesno you when i ask her a question and haha ok when i answer my own question she even leaves me on read sometimes should i stop texting her i really do not understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she will not even try to support the conversation just saying sorry i do not want to talk to you anymore would have been a lot less painful
0,cameron woke up at a m from a strange noise coming from the kitchen she thought it must have been mrs chives from upstairs doing something cameron is a cautious girl so she got up to check it out just in case she grabbed her pepper spray from the drawer of her bedside table and slowly walked towards the kitchen door she pushed the door half way open quietly and stuck her head inside she looked around the kitchen but did not see anything being annoyed by the whole ordeal she dragged herself back to bed she almost fell asleep again untill she heard someone humming at the end of the hallway with a womans voice cameron is also a very downtoearth girl so she tried to find a reasonable explenation for it it is like a reflex maybe someone is lost or something she said to herself in a trembling voice the humming sound kept getting louder and more intence and the room got a bit cold her bedroom door was half open and the only thing that lit up the room a bit was the moonlight shining through the window she kept staring at the hallway and breathing heavily listening to the humming sound she thought of asking who it is but she was not that bold out of the darkness from the hallway she could see two bright red eyes she just sat up on her bed and had her eyes wide open she did not know what to do so she panicked she closed her eyes tight and tried to convince herself that it was just a dream as soon as she opened them she saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed with the bright red eyes it whispered something to her but she could not understand it mostly because she was terrified and extremely anxious it reached over to camerons face and she could see it is hand in the moonlight it was as white as snow before she could do anything her window opened and someone jumped inside the figure with the red eyes turned facing the other person it started hissing and it vanished in thin air cameron could not believe her eyes who is that someone who saved her did you like my story so far if you want to find out who that person is and what that creature was doing there read my next post

1,so the point in being alive i ask myself this everyday and there really one there is no point in being here you live to die and everything in the middle is a pointless void
1,i feel as though eventually i am going to kill myself told a couple friends this told me that i need to see my therapist more and that i need to get back on my meds but what if content with this thought i remember the last time i was truly happy at best content most of the time though in a shitty mood i really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that commit suicide i definitely give a fuck when people get worried when i say that going to do it eventually it is what is not happy i never will be when i tell my therapist that never be happy he asks me if i can predict the future obviously i fucking but if the last years have been any indication of what my happiness is going to be then it going to get any better with all of that said and here i go contradicting myself but all of what just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me terrified that starting to give less of a fuck also while i think ever truly be happy i still have hope that i will be one day but not looking good
1,i am new to this so i do not really know where to start so hopefully if i stumble a little you will help me out i am the mother of beautiful children ranging in age from months i have a good job a loving supportive husband and several very good friends and i am once again in relapse and on medication i do not know why i thought that i was ok maybe because i had been drug free in my treatment for the last yrs or because things did not seem so chaotic this time before someone noticed i was different there was no one thing i could determine that triggered me this time and it is worse now than it was the last time i am hoping that perhaps some of you might be able to assist me in understanding what happened because quite frankly i thought i would be ok after the last treatment i had and it was all in vain

1,i sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years i am going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such too late i just backspaced two whole sentences there is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things i like such as drawing and reading i love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create sometimes though i get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms heck i get really jealous of people in my life and around the world young people i just get this sinking dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that i am wasting my young years doing nothing i am now and looking back on my life i have just been a sad pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous i am wasting my young years i am wasting my young years it plays over in my head all the time i cannot get my brain to shut off every night before i go to bed it plays over and over i am just so sad and disappointed in my life and how i have done nothing with it even as a little kid i never did anything fun and i do not have any wild stories of adventure excitement nor things like lol we were dumb kids yada yada we did this all the time yada yada i am sorry for the rant writing it out did not help me get the chants out of my head i am so sad guys and i know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives but there are people who were born years before me who are real yes and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things right now i want to go out rent a solid and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky i want to go do something fun and amazing but knowing i have wasted so many years being depressed in bed on my computer sleeping and just doing nothing will haunt me forever please take me back to being a little girl again let me try again please
1,well it is nearly time i swore to myself that i will not be dealing with depression by the time i will be shit my is toddling along shortly so i will have only one more year to keep my promise gee no idea whether i be able to make it but i swore to myself that i have to have the darn depression stuff under my wings by then so keep your fingers crossed for me the clock is ticking ps heh heh just thought since i look nearly presently maybe i could get a bonus day or two of extension because of the depressing reflection in mirrors what do you think
1,martin luther king jr and depression as my sufferings mounted i soon realized that there were two ways in which i could respond to my situation either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force i decided to follow the latter course king jr today got me thinking we need to figure out how we can turn our discontent anxiety anhedonia insecurity self hatred and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see touch and feel proud of in a tangible form we need to figure out as a community how we can redirect our negative feelings into helping others and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves i think alot of us feel meaningless and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed besides our rare and far between moments of clarity if we could find a way to redirect our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in we could change the world while at the same time changing this point in my life i have a good job and financial security but i still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that i am a failure and living a meaninglessness existence i have come to find that the only time i really feel alive or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when i am either on drugs or when i am helping people and making a difference the latter of those two has actually improved my life and i am hoping that as a depression community we can motivate eachother to help redirect our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us and hopefully squash our cynicism the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another

0,this is kind of a wierd thing having the opportunity to write about nothing in particular with no intended audience i am not really sure if this is something i will do or not but maybe i will give it a whirl and see how it goes basically heres my story i am from a small town in southwestern minnesota i grew up raising cattle and growing corn wheat and soybeans i had and still have both my parents as well as a brother and two sisters i was a smart kid in my high school and was always in the top of my class i never partied or got in trouble and was generally a good kid then i went to college i went to ndsu in fargo nd in the fall of there i learned to appreciate the sweet necture of life that was and is beer there i met some of my best friends and learned of the best mixes of all manners of alcohol we partied hard for wonderful years then i got a letter from the dean i was asked not to come back to ndsu in the fall they figured that having years to think about things i would be better off well what is a guy to do this guy decided he needed to get his head on straight i went out to work as a camp cook at a bible camp i had went to as a kid it was a rustic fort in the black hills of south dakota with no electricity or running water all i had to cook with was a fire and a hand pump it was wonderful we would shower only once a week hike miles a day and have lots of time just to commune with nature while i was out at the camp i talked with a friend who was changing schools the fouryear schooling at a typical college was wearing on him and he needed something different he was joining up with a buddy that went to a tech school for fluid power technology hydraulics and pneumatics primarily well i thought that sounded as good as any options i had so i signed up over the phone never set foot in the building til the first day of class turned out that was one of the best decisions i ever made but that is probably enough for now if anybodys even reading this i will fill some more in later cheers drewbie

1,finished my goodbye letters would just like to vent a little before i hang up my hat for the last two months i went through hell with my relationship to my gf that i was planning on proposing to right before this all began since may she is been telling me how she is depressed and does not know why and that our relationship is failing because of it i did absolutely everything i could to help even changing so many things about myself this went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eyes things were turning around for the better well june i found out the reason for all this was that she was talking to a coworker that lives down the street and began sleeping with him while i was at work unfortunately i snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and i just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder days later she calls the cops and days after that i am arrested for domestic battery we were planning a life together and i have never felt so betrayed after a couple days i began to see the light and once i did my mother had a heart attack and i cannot help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress normally if i had family problems i would turn to kaitlyn my gf and if i had gf problems i would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country well now i have no one to turn to and i am spiralling out of control last night i spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers i am going to try and enjoy the next couple days and then i am pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory you have always been a huge help reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point if convicted which i most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible hell i will probably lose my current job once my name begins to get drug through the mud idk where i am going with this just really needed to vent to someone that is not going to just tell me keep your chin up and things will get better like my friends and family they just do not understand the dark place that i am in right now i have dealt with what i believe to have been mild depression for about the last years living in a very racist area and being half fillipino and half white i have never truly felt like i fit in anywhere and am just tired i am ready for peace
1,becoming fat perhaps due to my meds some of them have side effects pertaining to increase in appetite and weight gain and perhaps due to my ridiculous comfort eating i have become fat which is very obvious because i am short and have a small frame plus all my tailor made clothes fit me exercise and the lot work in fact exercised minutes or more every day in the last month after all not a young person i do very strenuous exercise and my metabolism is probably low so exercise itself burn off the additional calories consuming so this is it stopping with the crazy eating
1,help hey i know if this is the right place to post this but i need help about to have my college degree and have a pretty solid job but mentally so fucked i had a rough breakup about a month ago and ever since just been down amp depressed feel like shit about myself like i can do no right like i have nothing to live for and had struggles with depression before but this time seems much more intense and worse like it ever go away been thinking about suicide more and more and i know what to do

1,i have never liked myself honestly i think that my entire life i have been depressed but now that i am older yo i have realized what it actually is all my life i remember hating myself and wishing i could be somebody else i thought it was normal i always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action i took the only time i ever felt happy about myself was after a psilocybin mushroom trip but that is besides the point i have always hated myself but i was too naive to know what it was and i thought it was normal why cannot i be normal edit you know what fuck this i am going to edit this i do not think i will get better i do not think there is a better way of living anytime i am happy or over it it all comes crashing the fuck down and becomes worse i do not trust that fucking shit called happiness it is always a lie and always let us me down i would rather be depressed and suicidal because at least i know it is real it is not some bullshit fleeting feeling that i get that leads to disappointment reddit comments and therapists and shit can tell me i am mistaken but that is all bullshit because it is all a fucking lie and the only real emotion is emptiness fear self loathing and paranoia sorry but for me that is it case closed
1,i wanted to kill myself tonight i am not sure if this is the right sub for this but i have had a very rough few weeks with finding myself jobless financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that i decided to write this little note in my phone the ending is supposed to sound funny it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole i was in tonight tonight under a drunken wine induced depression followed by the realization that someone i trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom while sobbing with my hands in my face trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt i looked up to see my cat staring at me she has this stern mothering expression in her eyes and we locked eyes for the longest time she kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and i really thought about my actions maybe she just wanted wet food i am really bad at remembering to take my meds and usually the day or two where i forget does not have this effect on me but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so apparently it did i have not felt suicidal in years and i just need someone to understand where i am coming from

1,me too you want a friend you want someone to be there with you when weak and someone to comfort you when down you wish you alone but you feel invisible trapped in your thoughts and nobody can reach you you feel like you do anything right like useless everybody has friends except for you a burden and nobody actually likes you you just exist you push people away because you feel like you have anything to offer so rather just be left alone you wait to die because life is pointless you want to get up anymore because been knocked down too many times so tired and weak and the weight is crushing you even more every day that passes is the same and you feel like waiting for nothing life get any better because it just sucks and you wish you did not exist

1,i am a single white gentleman i have dealt with depression since the age of and it has gotten worse over the years not having any family friends is not helping any it is been this way for years now my depression got really bad when i graduated from high school and my parents turned their backs on me while everyone else was looking forward to a bright future my parents had the attitude of screw you you are on your own they refuse to help me in any way which has caused unbelievable problems for me unemployment being the biggest thing having a friend is not the cure all but it would definitely help a lot i feel so hopeless and alone i tried other internet groups but found them to be nothing but a waste of time just looking for someone who can relate and will not judge me i am fully aware that this is not a dating site but i would prefer to find a female friend if anyone is interested and or has any questions about me feel free to contact me
1,i was rejected amp i feel great last night i asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected but strangely enough i do not feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished to provide some background i will be turning on the and last year just days after my birthday i was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder this disorder is characterized by long lasting essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting at least years and in many cases such as with myself far longer to provide a rough estimate i have been depressed somewhere around a total of years of my life the depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life at times making me cold and even cruel the most egregious example of this was when after having dated this girl for a few months i stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because i was refusing to talk to her at the time because of the depression i thought little of myself seeing myself as a worthless scumbag and so i started acting like one i was also afraid to open up to some else so instead i became emotionally cold and avoidant i hated this behavior in myself and held a deep guilt for how i had treated women i had been with so about years ago i stopped dating entirely despite being rejected having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing so having done so i feel a great sense of accomplishment this has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence even though i was rejected there is no real point to this story but i just wanted to get this out there because i am really proud of the progress i have made so far
1,i cannot even handle the suicide hotline i tried calling them and as soon as the guy on the other end started speaking i had an incredible sense of fear and i started to cry and hung up fuck fuck fuck fuck that guy could be saving lives and i am here fucking wasting his time i really should just fucking kill myself

0,it was summer the leather seats on my grannys navy blue cadillac were hot and sticky going to the bank with granny was a normal kind of errand for me and my little brother the first american bank tellers were very kidfriendly they always sent suckers for us kids when they sent back the money for granny on this particular day granny had a telephone set in the floorboard of her car she was the queen of mailorder catalogs and she had gotten this red telephone with a red cord and handset from one of the many catalogs that filled the end tables at her house the phone had big black touch tone buttons and i was amusing myself by making lots of clicking noises as i dialed familiar numbers in my yearold self was impressed by the thought of a phone in the car no one that i knew like my parents family or friends owned a car phone as we rode down nolensville road dialing those numbers made my imagination wander and soon the receiver found its way to my ear i became lost in a whirlwind of conversations instantly i became a wealthy young woman since i had a car phone who was talking to famous people like country singer reba mcentire or actor patrick swayze patrick called me right as we pulled up to the teller at the bank granny would have to get my sucker for me today i was far too busy talking with patrick about doing a movie next month to stop and wave at the smiling lady behind the glass i felt so important i rode around talking on my car phone for at least two weeks until my brother pointed out that you could see the cord and that made me look dumb he was just jealous that reba did not want him to come over and go swimming in her new heated swimming pool

1,what a great topic the news always makes me cry and i end up turning it off shortly after i start watching it why do i punish myself my parents know that i have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it has on me so if something really important is going on they let me know my aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion and i have had numerous conversations with her on how to handle the depression because she is tried so many different things even going to mexico to see a shaman her top suggestions and i really go by them as much as i possibly can are get proper sleep this is probably the most paramount point get proper nutrition and do not watch the news the one thing that i absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animals that really sends me when i am flipping thru channels and happen upon animal planet and the animal police are busting people because of their cruelty i have to turn it immediately i think i am delusional too in that i choose not to watch the news animal stories anything really unpleasant i guess i try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness i know that it is not very mature or adult but this is my coping mechanism i do find that when i hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really gets into gear and then i am completely negative for awhile driving is also incredibly difficult because i commute into washington d c from the suburbs and traffic is awful i become so negative about the other drivers around me that i end up hating myself over my thoughts about them they of course drive too slow and are idiots i need to find a job close to home i too have sometimes felt that the human race needs to think about not populating the world anymore i would not want to raise a small child in this environment any more i am glad my son is in college and he is the only one that i could have but then again i cannot wait until my sister or brother has kids so that i can be with them and spoil them rotten crazy is not it i have taken others suggestions in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last days it is difficult but possible i notice that my mood has brightened somewhat too thanks to you all for this thread as i think it really can help

1,escapism and depression sorry about the selfpity rant that is inbound needed to get this out there somehow this morning i was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off i know pretty edgy behavior but it is my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work i finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior stupidly i had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot the writing was not even terribly good the only reason i enjoyed myself was because i could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character the story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married settles in with his newfound friends and alls good for the time being you know the typical insert generic ending here bullshit fast forward to this morning i am in the shower and start thinking of my day to come making mental todo lists and stressing about my current temporary problems but somewhere along the line i start thinking of the stupid story i cannot help but start comparing my life with that of the main character and think about how much i would give just to be able to live a more meaningful less real life then i start comparing myself to the character and realize just how useless i am like holy shit i am almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork of course i cannot lead a meaningful life i am not worthy of any of it thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much as i started puking what little i ate all over my shower floor and crying i do not know i enjoy escapism probably to a fault but it is the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant i will probably come to terms with my role as human being someday many thanks to anybody who bothered to read this wall of text

0,drifting away from my best friend my best friend and i have known each other for well over a decade and have gone to the same schools and last year when she went away we text everyday and see each other regularly but recently been feeling so disjointed from her really close and told her things never told anyone she just got into her first serious relationship had sex for the first time got drunk for the first time and also had her first pregnancy scare i was with her when she took the test by the way however whenever we talk always about her life and her boyfriend she built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things i want to support her but she makes it so hard she never asks about my life anymore going through a really tough time yet never come up all we talk about is her and her relationship i know a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like just drifting apart i relate to her anymore obviously i love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her i know whether to keep putting effort into this friendship or not using a throwaway bc she knows my account

1,how does it going all who read my name is greg i am and have had depression for basically as long as i remember heres a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments i have endeavored i began on lexapro it seemed to be helping and then it quit on me or perhaps vice versa after that i tried zoloft and wellbutrin but to the same effect then i turned my world to narcotics mainly marijuana and dxm they helped alot but because they are illegal i felt a constant public stigma and guilt i could not take it despite the amazing effects of both drugs i am now taking paxil cr but i am going to quit it because it is not working i am beginning to lose hope altogether it seems apparent to me that ssris just am not for me or maybe i just have not found the right one the real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it is going to work those months can feel like years anyways that is who i am i hope to make a few friends here and a lot of advice as well does anyone one else share these symptoms if so and if you think you can help contact me please chronic fatigue lack of motivationdesire inability to enjoy life insomnia including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms the real killer is i know i have the potential to be someone great but i have to become happy first greg

1,does anyone elses depression causes them to constantly daydream or imagine their lives are a documentary i daydream a lot about people i know in real life or situations i wish would happen it is alternate reality i go to escape my loneliness i sometimes daydream about being in a hotel in some tropical paradise or being in a very romantic date or just that i am in some kind of reality tv showdocumentary where i am the star and the narrator at the same time and everyone admires me my mental state worsens once the daydreaming is over and i realize it is just fantasy
1,dropped back into a depression feels like travelled back in time anyone else feel like this about this time a year ago went through a very rough patch due to depression and it was one of the lowest points in my life slowly but surely started to get better or rather more numb eventually was ok not happy but could function fine fast forward to today and suddenly dropped back into my depressed mindset as though just woke up from a year long sleep like been going through some fugue state weird and scary but also familiar and comfortable in the worst ways feel so awful but life also feels more real than it has in the past year suddenly remembering all of my regrets and aspirations and relationships that had just pushed down and suppressed and awful but also it feels like found a missing part of myself this is rambley and know if it makes any sense but just wanted to put it out there
0,holly is the biggest bitch helping with band this year she can wipe my butt with her tounge damn lifes a bitch
1,thoughest time of my life and honestly i cannot show it so i meet this girl for nearly years ago i would say we are probably more then best friends we are soul friends for over a year we talked about me moving to their town so i can get closer to her her husband and her kids we have literally been talking for nearly years straight i understand that she is getting abit tired of me now but i just moved week ago and she has bearly talked to me once she is so busy playing video games right now the only one that really has helped me this past week is her husband i feel i moved so far for nothing and now its killing me and since i will not have internet for a while i am getting bored out of my mind and my depression is hitting me so hard i did confront her about this though but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games even tho when i play games she keeps going to private worlds with friends and whenever i as for an invite she ignores it even tho it pops up a big icon on her face my life has been so hard lately my mom lost her kids in court other then that my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun and no i did not do anything to a kid just fyi i won the case but it was ever lasting years other thatn that i have been bullied for years i have lived alone for since i was aswell i am a very very jelous guy so i am not going to deny that and here is one of the issues with this my ex fucked my life up with cheating on me and since then i have big trust issues aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me tho i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart the past months has been depression only and honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past months with suicidal thought every day they would of gone mental i have a very strong mind so it takes alot to take me down mentally but for some reason i am lost and i do not know what to do half of the time i just want to sit and cry before i was friend with her i had a depression but it was not that bad i did not have friends then so i did not have to go through what i have now for some reason i feel like i am not designed to have friends that my life should keep going on the pc without real friends
1,i empathize more with the dead than i feel bad for the living there have been a few times in the past few years where i found out someone i went to high school with died of whatever means but within the past few months whenever i found out someone died i did not really feel bad for their family i mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and i was still here for example my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital she told me one of her nurses daughters died of a deadly disease at and all i could think about was at all i could think was how jealous i was of the deceased young woman and how lucky she was no ill will to her i hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping another example when i was in high school someone i knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home he died choking on his own vomit again i feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this but mostly i just wish i was the one that was dead

1,i am sorry for the life i chose i just want another chance i regret every decision i have made in my life like to list the off not in order of reason or value to me but just randomly i have really bad teeth because i just drunk alot of fizzy drinks and did not take care of them secondly this was because of that but i because shy and anxious all the time thinking about what people thought of me so did not make many friends in school then during school my attention gravitated towards video games and my grades became shit therefore felt like university was not an option for me i was taking to this girl i liked and she did not seem to bothered about my appearance more my personality but she was interested in someone else i got really attached to her and ended up losing her and a good friend because i became too attached i regret all of this times over if i could relive my live i would regardless of the emotional scares and events that i went through
1,constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live since i was about i have had recurring suicidal thoughts the thing is i do not have low self esteem or anything of that sort it is actually quite the opposite and i always joke about being a narcissist i may not be an actual narcissist but i have always had a slight superiority complex i do not hate myself but i just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living on the outside i have always been the life of the party but deep down i do not ever remember being happy as someone who is highly ambitious it feels as if there is a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world and wanting to stop existing yet with the prospect of the latter comes the failure of the former i know that if i lowered my expectations in life i would be mildly happier yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload i have been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general i have considered getting help but i feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone since i am not a very emotional person i have come to accept that i will probably never be happy i have always wondered if i would be more likely to actually commit suicide if i ever attained the level of success i desire since i would have then achieved my goal in life or if that would finally bring me the contentment i seek i suppose it would be the former since i can never be content
1,i have been on celexa for a month now at first it was great i was dizzy and drowsy but my moods were much better i had a tolerance that i never had before the bad part was i could not eat i am over that now lol i do however have the oddest sleep patterns i fall asleep everyday around for an hour but cannot seem to get to sleep at night i wake up tired as for the end of this month i feel normal or maybe i am just used to it the one thing that bothers me is i am normally a emotional person and i fear that i have become numb i do not feel things the way i used to which is i guess the point of it i have experienced weight loss however i am grateful for what it has done for me i am able to see my situation clearly and think about myself now
0,there are so many people in the world some of us are trained and broken and some of us are jst broken by choice reality sucks and everyone knows it if you want a meaning in life then you have to find it but if you want to suceed in life you have to be buried in there really a choice in what we want why do people hate does anyone know i htink that people hate out of fear fear of change fear of difference and fear of everything staying exactly the same everyone wants what they cannot have unless they do not have anything at all then they want nothing but need everything but if you have it all you want everything and need nothing we inven tmore and more things to make life simple but in turn it just makes everything more difficult you have money therefore you do not know what its like to be without or if you do not have any money you do not know what its like to have everyone is unique we have our own thoughts that is what makes us who we are we all like and dislike different things we all believe in different things and everyone says they like it that way but as soon as they find out someone is different from them they want to sprint in opposite directions of eachother or they wnat to make eachother like themselves everyones perfect you all say were not because everyone makes mistakes and that is what makes us perfect our differences and mistakes noone is perfect to us because we base our lives on imperfection therefore noone knows what perfection is in order to find out who you are you have to experience as much as you possibly can or else your not giving yourself a chance to be happy thank you for reading this even though i know its really scattered and probably makes no sense to you i apologize
0,is it bad that i am kind of mad my friend never follows my advice the friend in question and i have been friends for over years and best friends for the last years and have shared just about every detail of our life i am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years the heading is a bit misleading here i am not mad at her that she follow my advice rather i am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life i have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that however she seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her this just happen once or twice but it happens almost on a daily basis and i can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating i have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind i know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you follow that super easily and i have been trying very hard to be as supportive as i can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on but also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem and it seems like she learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people and it also makes me very anxious when i constantly worry about her but i want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions and i know what to do help pls i am desperate

0,question what is this blog about why is it here who the hell are you and why do you think that this deserves to take up valuable internet real estate well i will tell you grasshopper this blog is a test a personal test a test designed to push my own boundaries and maybe just maybe bring into being something bigger than just another shitty internet blog ultimately this blog will be a place where i can give wings to my voice and throw open the doors that hold back the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts that dance their way through my headspace ambiguous enough for you on a specific note i am hoping to eventually provide enough detail about my personality and ideasideals that at some point in the future my posts can be used to create a simulacrum of myself some sort of personality that will capture the essence of what i am about but that is more of a long term goal short term this blog will aim to provide myself with a sounding board for my own thoughts and emotions a place where i can cry out to my imagined readers and tweak my opinions the title of the blog generation gap reflects a deep emotional feeling that i have regarding being labeled by society and falling down into the generation gap or generation trap hopefully my rantings will address this give the site a feel of changing for the better so who the hell am i i am me i am someone who is searching someone who is constantly looking not sure what he will find but making the most of the journey of discovery i am someone who is sick to death of the crap passed down to us by society in an unconscious attempt to mold us and tell us how to be i am someone who is trying to push my own boundaries to discover my own mettle and shine in whatever way i can i am me as for why this site should exist well simply put because i want it to it represents an extention of my will into an infinate void the interent where there exists plenty of room for everyone to play so if you run into this site and do not like it do not read it do not come back sorted this site exists for me but if someone else benefits from it then fantastic next question
0,hoss is my bulldog for anyone that sees this but does not know me and he is a spoiled one at that this how we have found him when we came home on several occasions you cannot see it in the picture but there was a corona on the railing and his daddy was grilling hamburgers for us including him i wonder what he does that we do not see maybe i do not want to know eh anyway he does weigh at least lbs here he still thinks he is small enough to be a lap dog and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it of course at that point i am pinned and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair but he has more kisses than i can stand sometimes and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit i am definitely a bulldogger
0,should we be angry at our parents for forcing us to suffer through their deaths people always say no parent should have to bury their child yet our parents did not care that by having us we would have to bury them and suffer through their deaths this is selfish and assumes love only runs one way as if sons and daughters cannot have a strong love for their parents should not we be angry at our parents for only being concerned with their own suffering
0,sick of this i am tired of being the one that always has to write to people if i would not do that i feel that they will not talk to me until they need me to do something for them i hate that i always get so attached to the people i bond with and what sucks more is the fact that i feel this thing is not reciprocal
1,what is your interpretation of happiness everyone seems to be fixated about obtaining it yet when i ask them what happiness is no one seem to be able to truly give me a definite answer how can one knows heshe attains happiness when that person does not even know what it is in the first place its like desperately trying to look for an item in your room but you do not know what that item even looks like so tell me do you have a definite definition of what it meant to be happy

1,well i have to admit that as a male i have always viewed my own depression as personal weakness i still do i cannot help it it is a notion feeling or philosophy or whatever that is been instilled from an early age i know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression i mean it is an illness right i have never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated at the moment i really cannot face my doctor with that sort of issue btw i am in my and i have suffered from depression since as long as i can remember i have learned to cope in a fashion but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social normality i e divorced emotionally empty relationships enormous amounts of time spent alone dissatisfied working life etc one covers up disguises the depression at work at home and where have necessary and then when you are all alone the demons can come out to playor even before you are alone but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity most of the time for example today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because i have been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week i made an excuse to put off his visit because i did not want him to see me feeling low depressedand weak and thus ruining his dayweek instead i went out on a freezing mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression this is a regular occurrence i get depressed i hate myself for being weak so i do something physical to try to alleviate the symptomsand also to punish myself for feeling depressed it works temporarily in my mind this sort of masochism is or has beenpreferable to taking alcohol drugs even prescribed medicines fags therapy or inflicting real selfharm and so forth because at least it keeps me feeling physically fitphysically balancedand i guess that is important to me even if it is not always an effective cure for ones depression and i can keep up the public pretence that all is well sorry back to the point yes it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence one wonders what the real percentage could be when i joined this group yesterday it was the first time i had openly voiced the notion that i do suffer from depression not so macho perhaps my condition is getting worse or maybe i am just feeling a little more realistic about what it is to be a male suffering from depression are there many women or even men out there who are truly sympathetic to males who suffer from depression unfortunately i have not seen much evidence out there so far

0,uneasy family members i have had a rough and lonely childhood in fact i do not want to remember my childhood there used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad my mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now she behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house behaves as though we are a burden for her my dad is no angel either he is arrogant and adamant impatient and often has anger control problems never felt close to him when a child and even now never felt any love towards my parent i always had thoughts about running away from them to add fuel to the fire my fathers mother will try to instigate any fight on any trivial matter between my mom and dad i stayed all along with her throughout my childhood but i always thought of her as a monster she never allowed me or my brother to ever mingle with other children freely and we did not have many friends i feel suffocated between my family and want to move away from them shift to another place and be independent i have finished my graduation and still stay with my family but i feel they sap my energy and i am always negative and depressed staying with them criticism is a big part of our family you are not spared if you make even a minute mistake appreciation word is not in my familys dictionary on top of that my family is conservative and my mom is very very conservative in the bad sense she will criticize other girls and women for wearing slightly short or tight clothes but if someone wears the same clothes in our family she will applaude it my father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look he does not spare men either calling them names based on their physical features i am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible there is no room for opinion in my family especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions he does not spare me insulting in front of other people i do not feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them i have always felt hate for them in my heart and mind though they have provided me with all the facilities they have not provided understanding and love they never understood me what should i do
1,finally on the path to getting myself back i had a really bad panic attack last night that came out of nowhere and it enabled me to visit my doctor today and talk about my depression she gave me some prescriptions and referred me to several therapists i am finally going to start taking meds so hopefully in about a month i will start getting my life back hell even if these particular meds do not agree with my system just the fact that i have taken my first steps in my journey is enough hope for me
0,this is my first attempt at keeping any sort of journal i have never been very good at keeping any sort of record of my life i have always had the fear that once an experience is put on paper the brain no longer has a need to remember it and the memory is thus discarded or rerouted for use in another way therefore i am rather skeptical to put much of note down here too soon perhaps my mind ramblings will be just that ramblings nothing more nothing less or perhaps i will learn that the more i jot down the more i will be able to remember the brain never ceases to amaze me it remembers things long since forgotten in a way perhaps that is where dejavue comes from i am constantly in a state of rememberance that is the way that i know i am on the right track in life whenever i do not get a memory of something that i am doing that i know i have never done before i know that what i am doing is that which i am supossed to be doing my life otherwise might get very complicated and then where would i be a friend from my childhood has had a very trying life and started blogging to sort things out i am very proud of her for that she is who made me decide to try it i do not really have an outlet for my life my husband has a hard time understanding my need for higher and higher education that is not to say that he is not supportive or encouraging by any means it is just that he felt a bachelors degree was all that was really needed i on the other hand feel that i need to get more i am in the process of completing my ba in molecular biology and a minor in chemistry only to persue a dvmphd combo in the next perhaps i will obtain that goal but for now i am just looking forward to finally obtaining my first degree and it has only me since years sabatical for work and my son etc basically life in general well that is it for my first blog perhaps next time it will be more insightful
0,an online journal sounds intriguing if only to keep my thoughts in order i have long ago given up writing in my journal due to the illegible scribble that is my long hand the past few years would have made for some good reading and i will regret not having those thoughts to look back on i suppose i have my memory but even that seems to be failing me in my old age or thru all the drama drama is not neccessarily negative but tonight i am wishing for a somewhat drama free past tonight when i scan the postings of my name via the web i come accross a memorial to him someone in his high school class found out that he is dead and they are looking for stories in regards to their beloved fellow student i sit here at this desk and the air leaves my chest and is not replaced for what seems like a great while a connection to him a connection to my soul i miss him so much i miss my husband i miss nobles father i miss sharing with him laughing i do not laugh so much anymore and i used to live for laughter now when i do it seems empty and hollow i feel fake when i am laughing maybe the drugs will remedy that maybe when i laugh again i will feel some connection maybe this wonder drug will connect it all back in my brain again but for now it seems all disconnected and although i have pretended that i have been on track for the past few years i am a liar my mantra has been it is ok well it fucking is not ok far from ok i want to tell people that but when i do they run from me i am always to be the strong woman the strong leader how imressed they all are by my resilliance well guess what mother fuckers it is fake i am crumbling and you do not even know it or if you do you do not care enough to say a thing stay away and suzy will pop back up like a wilted peace lily getting a much needed drink i wish i could tell them that i am angry and that they too will understand my life when they watch their husbands die of cancer watch as the man that you love dies while his baby grows in your belly i was cheated i was robbed and i have tried to make the best of it i have waited for the best it is alluding me i just want some understanding a strong shoulder to lay my head upon so that i can rest i am tired of holding myself up i am tired of running the show i am exhausted and weary where is my stamina in the form of a human

1,i am years old i live in the metro detroit area and i have had depression for the past years my parents refuse to admit i have a problem at one point i used to cut myself and at another point i was rushed to the er to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose basically i joined this forum so i can realize for myself i am not the only one with problems my depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too i have a loving boyfriend whom i have been with for months now which i am extremely sure that he has helped me next year well in the fall i will be moving away to college which i actually think will be a good thing for me i am also a cheerleader at my school which does not help with my depression i am constantly under pressure about that i am also a dancer my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing i do wrong it seems as if nothing i do is good enough or right which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating with the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me i am fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day i know it is not healthy and i know it is not good but i personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house thanks for listening
0,my favorite friend left our friend group he is kind of cocky and selfish but i like the guy and i saw him as kind of this professional extrovert because he is just so confident and knows lots of people and i kind of looked up to him for that he made a valuable asset to my friend group of but suddenly he just left for another friend group a group that is filled with selfish annoying sport fanatics and they are very passive agressive towards him but he seems to enjoy it even though i think that he would have it much better in our friend group where we all just have fun with eachother and just act friendly i know about letting something go and if it does not come back then it was not meant to be but i really miss the guy ps we are all guys

0,super smash bros melee is my most favorite game in the world it is a fourplayer fighting game that has super simple moves compared to other fighting games however do not think that it is an easy game to beat and no fun to play you still must master moves for a character just like you would for any other fighting game you have to know when to sidestep dodge jump and attack your opponent you have to know when to roll behind and when to retreat only true master can beat giga bowser and the master and crazy hand not only do you have to beat classic adventure and allstar mode you also have to beat all the event matches and get all trophies this is a must have for any gamecube owner and that means you buy it now i am saying this out of my own love towards the game and i am not a walking advertiser recently there was a melee tournament in our area and out of two and a half pages worth of people guess who came out first me i got hoards of stuff i love being the best at melee surprisingly they never got me down to one life it consisted of many three life stock battles i brought my memory card and they let me use it because they had no characters i have percent beaten that game also i have kept a profile name it has over wins and around fifty losses no i play my brothers and level cpus i stopped the playing timer at that is around hours and i know that i played more than that i am a freak of this game and have emailed nintendo multiple times on when the next super smash will come but they said there has been none announced if you know please tell me i hope the ds will have the game just think portable super smash if you think you can beat me in melee i think i can beat you you may not be easy but i am trying to become the best in the world come talk to me if you love super smash bros melee i also have the original super smash bros but i think it is nothing compared to melee all you have to do in that game is throw it is fake but i still like it you can talk to me about that too dr mario is cheap

1,this morning m finally confessed and now i know the truth this is summer here i realize i spend a lot of time talking about food the weather and nudity on this blog but these seem to be reoccurring themes of my new life and really what is more important than having nice food while naked in excellent weather not much i say so despite the long arduous months of patiently awaiting the promised beauty of a dutch summer what i am really getting is this virtually constant canopy of grayblack clouds check scarves and light jackets lest the freezing summer temperatures turn your nipples to stone check got your umbrella for sudden downpours that may or may not contain hail check check surly attitude because you cannot wear your pretty sandals unless you like blue toes and your boyfriends been lying to you for months about the upcoming lekker warm weather check and check and check try to ignore that previous blog entry within which i detailed all the nice things about holland at this time of year and the fact that the weather was ovenhot apparently that was a freak of nature though i do still love the little lambs
0,these parents physically hurt their teenage daughter by burning her with hot oil and hitting her with broomsticks due to her refusal to marrying a man much older than her who is paying this horrendous story just goes to show that your family is not always this happy loving caring group of people who want the best for you sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs and it is very important to know when to say no and walk away if you can especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what it becomes very hard to go against them and say no but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety

1,ok i have a couple of questions i guess is i finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist it is not till may now i am having second thoughts about it i just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation to see if there is a problem and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts i have been having i have got a summer job i am leaving for in june and than i am moving to another city after that so basically something till i am stable with where i am living and job i assume i am only going to be able to see doctor time before than so thoughts have been should i just wait to see someone when i actually get settled also if a psychiatrist is who i want to see i have never been to anyone before for my mental health that is what the intake coordinator suggested also i was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions and just so people know i do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself one main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughtsactions i often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when i feel relatively normal mood wise and that when i have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind but the pain is more severe i guess that is really all i have sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum i just wanted to ask and maybe discuss with someone but do not really feel that it is a problem for me right now if someone wants to talk in pms i would not mind either

1,a letter to my sister who has conquered her depression the letter you always wanted to write family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered no one knew at the beginning you hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes before it all happened i sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you it is the way you used to hold your emotion it is as if you were full to the brim with it but you forced it down shoved it into a box and hid it away it was strange but i was too young to understand and then slowly but surely it took you over you were so young in my worst nightmares i imagined finding your lifeless body i wake you up you wake up my darling sister even now i still imagine your cold body how can such a deathly and frightening disease exist you wasted away your cheeks were concave and you even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled your eyes were dark holes in your face they were so empty you slept all afternoon and night i would lay my cardigan over you so you get cold but i think it made a difference you were lost to us floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us and then you tried to end it all multiple times when i think about it i blame you sometimes but i know that the blame is not really towards you it is towards me of course i am your sister i should have been your protector is it ok if i say that i really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course or is that just an excuse you are my best friend even though i am not always yours i wish i would be kinder to you but i probably will always hold some of myself away maybe i am punishing myself i know no one can say it take a toll on all of us you probably remember but we were going to the corner shop together once as we chatted you were vehement that you were a failure i asked you what on earth were you a failure at what life had you lived that you possibly could have failed and you said failed at life so what was the alternative my dear death telling you i lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand even as i am writing this i know where to start or end in my mind it is such a mess it matter because you are well now i have never seen someone work harder you are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special i tell you how much if i tried i hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won i hope you always believe you are a success i wish you all the happiness you deserve love you babe your sister

0,my sister wants to have an intervention with our parents about their marriage so my sister and i are both adults i am and she is neither of us live at home anymore i have my only own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage is not exactly happy our parents are basically polar opposites dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends however he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of disrespect if something is wrong it is never his fault you know the type mom is quiet and reserved not much on physical or verbal affection at all her only hobbyactivity is through music ministry at our church my dad joined the church when they got married but he is not religious really and only comes on the holidays lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship she is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight so much so that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage my sister and i have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced but that it will never happen because our mom is catholic i think an intervention would just make it worse because i know my dad will see it as a personal attack i am of the it is none of my business persuasion but i do not want to miss out on family time with my parents and sister we all get together every couple of weeks at my parents house for dinner and board games which i love i do not want to lose that any thoughts is there anyway to approach our parents without making it worse

0,pain in one breast and hard lump tumor vs fibrocystic breasts lately i have been feeling a random ache in my left breast it actually feels kind of like when i was lactating and go too long without nursing but not quite because that was a kind of pressure and fullness and this feels more like tenderness or like i have a deep bruise last night i rolled onto that breast while in bed and it felt like i had a bouncy ball in my breast something hard i felt my breast and i felt a hard lump deep inside against the muscle wall but kind of lumpy in there in general my right one feel lumpy i made an appt for a mammogram and the scheduler seemed concerned when i talked about the pain and lump she said to get a referral for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound not a screening mammogram my husband was looking up my symptoms and stumbled upon info about fibrocystic breasts it seems like it could be that but i really have no idea just wondering if anyone is out there who has similar pain with a tumor or fibrocystic breasts really not sure whether to be terrified right now pensive face
0,i just bought a home hiv test kit from actually two and a bottle of wet platinum that is stuffs yummy makes any session of selflove feel like you are again but maybe that is not a good thing hm of course i did not really need two tests nor the lube but man i am a sucker for bargains and i saved a whopping three cents for spending fifteen times more than i intended to i am a bargain shopping stud the package arrived yesterday at work but i did not want to prepare my blood sample in a shared bathroom stall so i thought i would do it after a rigorous game of bowling and you know how much bowling gets the heart pumping and the body ready for blood sample extraction you basically have to prick your finger on these little plastic apparati of course i was too afraid of getting pricked so i could not get enough blood out of my middle finger from the shallow wound i created so instead i doubled the pain by additionally having to prick my ring finger to get enough blood to fill this circle on the sample collection card okay okay it really was not that bad i have learned to type with eight fingers quite rapidly no really it is a lot better than getting blood taken out of your arm that is for sure the last time they did that the nurse bruised my arm and it hurt to masturbate i knew i should have given the nurse my left arm but i am really one big fuck up i just got tested a month ago but since then i fucked this guy bareback and then got hit by a flu that came out of nowhere and this guy i screwed apparently is allergic to latex and does not always have safer sex with his partners and did i mention i already have a boyfriend i can deal with fucking up my own life but when i start affecting other peoples lives i totally feel like shit and deserve more than just a couple of pin pricks on two fingers i cannot even be straight about it here i am recounting my home test kit experience with witty embellishments to hide the fact that i am a complete failure i cannot bargain shop i cannot prick a finger i am a cheat and i cannot even honestly post an anonymous blog but at least i saved three cents and got free shipping
1,for the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me does not make sense why does this pain happen to people this is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do why does life work this way i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way my depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me for the first time in high school i liked this girl for about months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes we always talked to each other including late night till or am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who did not like me and always kept lying about me to her she never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this one day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship she got angry at me and decided to leave too but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i did not understand why she liked him and she said she did not either it was only that she felt happy around him she is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she did not listen to me instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him now she is actually separating from him after all this time why did she do this to me after everything we have been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i do not know should i go back to her after what she did its been weeks and i have not talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem everyone knows i am depressed but at this point i could not care and i am losing my mind and i just need some answers of why she liked this asshole but not me

0,advice please am i in the wrong or is she overreacting this is going to be a long post this is my very first post me and now ex best friend just had a major falling out and blaming me a little backstory we were best friends did everything together babysat each others kids and just hung out all the time i have kids she has my youngest are month twins her youngest is month old girl i babysat last for her on nov before dropping her baby off i always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor nothing dangerous in her reach obviously i baby proofed for my kids she was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something i see and like babies do she stuck it in her mouth i went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but i get it and it made her gag not choke gag so i angled her down patted her back and it fell out she smiled at me when i turned her right side up obviously unfazed by what just happened i stayed calm and did what needed to be done no harm told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago she sends me a text right a text and basically tells me that i can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house been a red flag my house is lived in not a pig sty she said i dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she choked also i was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means i was lazy and see it as a big deal news flash it a big deal nothing happened she said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over sorry but if safe enough for my twins safe enough for her daughter she found something that i see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth i stayed calm responded and everything was fine should i apologize did i do something wrong she is refusing to talk to me face to face i feel like i should apologize for something every baby does i just believe she held onto this for so long even hung out since then and she never said anything just some advice please

0,i heard about a couple of jobs at work i applied for the other day i did not receive an interview i am pretty dissappointed about it i thought my application was quite good i was never expecting to get either of the jobs there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than i but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth all my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help it is a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it i am becoming a master this year it seems i offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion they all said it was pretty good but i only got a truly honest opinion from one my good friend anthony he told me that while it was good i used passive language which they warn you against i really appreciate his honesty you have to respect it i think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life you cannot waste a good friend i actually feel the bunch of guys i have met in the last couple of years while working where i am are the best i have ever made they are not like some of the friends i had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and i honestly do not think they ever thought about it or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you at some point you must grow up i was told by anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for dungeons and dragons dating back to edition and that diehards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it and i have to say if that is so then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life okay i love the game but really
1,ending my life if i turn things around me had become less interesting i have become so bored to the point i just do not want to live anymore i want to change but i realized i am just being a hypocrite so i am ending it i did not learn to love myself nor anyone i asked advices from acquaintances but their advices are all the same and day by day i have become more depressed and i did not tell anyone about it anymore because what is the point i wanted to live for my family but thinking i am dealing with my mental illness alone is hurting me and its just too much should i really end it

1,hi i am tracy and i have had depression and anxiety for about i am and a wife and mum to beautiful kids who deserve a mum who is not ill the biggest thing that gets me so frustrated with myself is the way depression makes me feel such a weak person before i was ill i had a job was the strong one where friends and family were concerned and basically could cope with whatever life threw at me now i am lucky if i can cope with getting through the day i am on efexor xl at the moment and have been for about a year it is so nice to post this and not worry about being judged it is lovely to know that other people understand well that is me
0,cheap gifts on the receivers side my friend and i are friends for about years we ended up going to different colleges but kept in contact online i think of them as my best friend but i am not sure if it is reciprocated every year i stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas a gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations a gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible i purchased their birthday gift is about lush soap and the christmas gift is about sweets the price of the cards are not included they got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday and a couple stickers for xmas there was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it last year they got me a gift with the receipt for my birthday my gifts were around the same value i try not to place too much importance on the price tag since it is the thought that counts but their gift to me is really cheap and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met i know they can afford to buy a gift they buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order i accepted their gift but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment i honestly thought it would of been better if they just did not give me a gift at all is this a sign are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little i am not sure what they are thinking or what should i do i know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option but i would rather know why they thought to give me this gift i could also brush this off as a one time thing but i think that this is not the case
0,so i swear i meet someone everyday that is so profound i do not think that i ever have the thoughts to equate to their greatness i met this guy once who changed my life in days of subbing for one of my classes a freelance actor better yet a freelance thinker i can see why people say that when you meet the right person you could run away with them and nothing would ever matter in the book catch they talk about running away and they debate that running away is bad because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you and the conclusion was that he was not running away he was running to his problems rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends sometimes with all of my set lifeplans i want to not forget that i cannot live inwhat will happen in the future but rather in this moment i never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment because i cannot wait for the next moment could that freelance thinker help me run away all i know is that when i want a serious relationship and even think about marriage i want to meet someone exactly like him who i can run away with to solve my problems head on and live in this moment
1,hi everyone i am a year old complete mess up i have suffered from depression most of my life about years ago my world crashed around my head i went into blackness like no other attempted suicide several time went through a period of self mutilation went on every depression drug known to mankind through years of therapy this lasted years i took a massive overdose and was on life support for days when i finally regained consciousness my doctor told me it was a miracle i was alive after that i seemed to put my life back on track i still suffered periods of depression but nothing extreme until now that is now i feel myself slipping into that hole again and i am terrified
1,could use some random late night friends i have started a prescription and it is at least two weeks for it to build but in the past week i have had nothing waiting a week until i can request an increase in dose looking for people who are generally online from central time hopefully i can move back to but the last three weeks have been more brutal than in a long time and i would love to be able to talk to people who will not make me feel insane for some of these thoights
1,i have no idea what to do my husband and i got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning through out the entire argument he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep i thought i was almost over my depression i thought i was getting better but the things he has said has taken me from where i thought i was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts the argument started because i was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour i am weeks pregnant and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me my husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because i tried to explain why i was so upset later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child then he spent several more hours talking about how they were rot gut whores and how he does not want them around his son all because years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew i was not going to show up for and did not specifically include my husband in the invitation yet his mom is coming a few weeks after and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it but because she has not done anything to offend me he is totally ok with her showing up now he is talking about how if i want my mom to be here so bad i can leave with her when she visits and i have fully expressed how depressed i am to him and he is not even worried in the slightest he just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life saying he bets i want to go back to that that i would treat his son better if he were black and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black part of me hopes something goes really wrong in the birthing process and that i will die or be put in a coma from it i have never felt so useless stranded and alone in my entire life
1,girlfriend on antidepressants no affection hi everyone my gf of years has been on antidepressants for about months there is a definite lack of sex drive since then but i understand that can be a side affect and she is acknowledged it and we have spoke about it but sex itself is not really the issue there is a distinct lack of affection we never make out or really kiss unless i initiate it or hug much it makes me feel shitty and lonely when i am consistently the one pulling her in for a hug etc i have spoken to her about it and she gets defensive and says she gives me plenty of affection and makes it seem like i have got a problem i am just wondering whether anyone has any thoughts on if this is also a side affect or whether lack of affection is completely down to her as an individual
1,anyone have some good sad song suggestions sad songs have always helped me keep going
1,i read the art of happiness a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it the dalai lama is something else i have forgotten a lot of it but i do remember him saying that we should strive to be unswayed by emotion so that we do not differentiate between good things happening or bad things i am the opposite of this when good things happen i feel good when bad things happen i feel bad i loved what you said about there being no such thing as self loathing in tibet i wonder if this means there is no depression i have always wanted to be a monk maybe that is the answer thanks for the interesting post harlequin i will now go and google breathing meditation by the way can anyone tell me how to post partial quotes do i have to erase the bits i do not want posted after hitting quote or is there another way

1,hi everyone my name is charlie and i have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things i first got onto the idea through a page called depression hurts at a hypnosis site hypnosis its worth plugging as i have found it useful it took a while to admit to myself that i was afraid of not belonging being criticized sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school this has been a turning point for me though working through the false learnings and memories so i thought i would share it in case it resonates with anyone else i have since recognized symptoms of inferiority in others and they vary widely from conceited arrogance to total withdrawal and it has been really great
1,i have not been on this site for awhile because everything was going pretty good tonight it is all falling down though i do not even know what to say right now i have just got to pound this keyboard there is so much to say but i cannot get it out correctly pretty pathetic when i cannot even say anything but leave me alone i sure wish there was someone to talk to someone to yell at you know just to yell around my neighborhood it would be a sign of not all there you know i finally see how a few of the people around here drive their cars off the cliff it is almost spring about another month to month and a half if i can just wait that long i can get out into the yard with the sun and feel better i have to keep thinking of that the sun and yard something to look forward to my feel good days must have been pretty good because this downfall is pretty lousy so lousy that i try to feel what i had been feeling but it is almost like i cannot remember it already
0,should i have kids why asking my mother has an undiagnosed mental illness of that i am certain my best guess is either bipolar or borderline personality disorder growing up with her was difficult and she never got the help she needed my brother and i suffered greatly as a result the scariest thing is when i occasionally find or think i find her mental illness in myself certain tendencies to obsess feel abandonment that real and lashing out because of it etc when that happens i just feel so disgusting and shameful in those moments i wish that she my mom and that i her son or that i could permanently swap heads with someone else i think about all this as my fiancé and i talk about having kids both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly though i brought up my fears to her i worry often about passing on that illness to our children my fiancé deserve that she have to face those hard challenges i love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside i feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that i wonder if i should be one at all or rather a biological one something never really thought about before now and i know what to do please help
1,am i depressed or is it something else this seems like a dumb question because to an extent i know i am depressed but not to a clinical level like i hate the situation i am in i hate being in debt i hate living where i live that sort of thing however i am not unmotivated like at all i am not hopeless i am not suicidal in any way i am terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that i will get so depressed that i will become suicidal which is weird i know but the point is nothing in me wants to die that being said i am tired all the time i mean physically exhausted which seems to contradict major depression i get up every day shower every day though i do not really want to go to work i go to work and do work with no issue it is more that i do not enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it is super fun it is just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that i am older and i am not doing what i thought i would be doing by this point in my life more than i hate my job i cannot think of many reasons why i would be this physically exhausted all the time literally every doctor says you you are just massively depressed no i do not believe i am depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted if i still have plenty of hope for the future want to get up want to get dressed want to shower want to look good how is this major depression to a point where i am also tired all the time is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things because if it is someone needs to tell me that any time a doctor tells me i must be depressed if i am so tired all the time and i tell them that i am not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go oh well i do not know what it is then i am very annoyed with this because i never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when i am positive my depression is not so bad it is only making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me i am frustrated so if anyone can answer this it would be helpful so i can see what avenue to pursue next note it is not a problem with my thyroid or adrenal gland i already had those checked twice by two different doctors
1,nothing is enjoyable anymore almost everything that i used to care for is simply starting to have no meaning i feel dead and lifeless i used to be very passionate with certain things but that was usually meant with me being bashed and shunned upon people or simply just a turn off everyday i wake up and angry always wondering what the hell the point of this is why here i used to be extremely suicidal in the past and slowly falling into that dark pit again i know what to do so hard to be happy and just starting to give up

1,okay so i am doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal so sam came and went not before i went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parents that i was in love with her yea umm i am gay i then told her that i thought moving to oregon was a bad bad idea not because i was in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you are in love with but has no interest in you not such a good idea so anyways that made things all fucked up and she left and we were not on the best terms besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart i did not get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues so now i am going to just move into her place we will see how that turns out if we kill each other or not i am not on the lease so if it sucks i can just move out there are a few boys that are into me however i do not think that my soul really wants to be with anyone right now i have something wrong with my heart i am doing blood work on monday to figure out what is going on and i took last week off for no reason at all so i guess a lot has happened in the last days i should really try to keep up with this journal
1,i seem to have depression the worst first thing in the morning lately just started with a new pdoc after months with another pdoc since this latest episode occured my old pdoc thought i could have a mild bipolar disorder but was not sure my mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable she started me on lamictal and i am now up to mg day stopped the prozac in early january and got worse but not right away i was having a good week bad week type pattern depending on where i was in my menstrual cycle while i was on the prozac i have battled depression on and off for years particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode i am years old and have not felt this bad since i had my daughter years ago my new doctor thinks i do not have an ounce of bipolar and that i am just in a depression i tend to agree with her we decided together to add lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month i have been on it almost weeks patiently waiting for some results i am well aware of the waiting game i am also taking xanax xr in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety i take my lamictal in the morning and a very small half of the lowest dose of xanax as well i seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after i take the lamictal xanax do not know if this is a placebo effect my question is has anyone experienced this a m depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day also does anyone take lamictal for unipolar depression the last thing i want is to be taking too much of anything and further putting off good health starting to wonder if the xanax xr in the evening is giving me this early morning dread

1,hi my name is jenna i am years old and just joined and figured that i should introduce myself i found this site from searching online and think that it is great i only started accepting the fact that i have been depressed last year because i have always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and i used to fool myself as well if that makes sense i have never been one to seek help from others because in the past i have always dealt with everything myself the start of college and being outside different state of my home environment which is the because of a lot of anger and resentment that i also have helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that i was living and that i could reach out and get help i am currently seeing a counselor through my college and since i feel like i am working well with her that i do not need to seek other outside help yet about my anxiety and depression but i feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well i am glad that i stumbled across these forums and i cannot wait to get to know some of you jenna

1,my latest addiction for pain relief cannabis and prescriptions were not doing enough so i added gay sex with men to my regiment i am not even attracted to men i just enjoy being sought after like a prize and the way that these guys appreciate my body when i am with them usually i just get massagedplayed with for an hour and then give a bj in return feels amazing to have another human be all over me even though i cannot ejaculate if you feel like you have given up and do not care about anything give this a try if you truly do not care then you will at least get to feel the comforting touch of another human
0,it is amazing what some people will do for fun and excitement although in telling about this i incriminate myself but anyway so we all a group of people i guess as opposed to dogs cats aliens or rubber duckies decided we wanted to take a walk along the canal however the weather decided it was going to rain at the same time now rain would usually stop a sane person from taking a walk outside but no no one ever said we were sane so we walked in the rain and lightning and thunder with umbrellas held high all in the name of fun and oh yeah exercise my official battle cry was it is just water hmm it is a shame we do not go out and play in the rain more

1,realising your mental state and life is unfixable sucks just started to realise this been working my way to suicide last year but it did not work out so i am trying my best how ironic to just feed myself everyday and not letting my emotions burden the ones i love or any person i come across basically just existing plainly i really wished i could show affection to those i love and care about but i realise that without any qualities as a person i am better off just not being a nuisance and a liability feeling lonely sucks i wished i feel loved by those whom i love but staying away while not killing myself is my only way to protect them from myself oh well thanks for listening
1,even if you hate them there is something gut wrenching about hearing parents fight i hate both of my parents they are mentally abusive to me and just a lack of care most of my life even so listening to them fight right now makes me really uncomfortable you would think my hate would just make me careless about it but its just not
1,my nightmare is living like this for the rest of my life i just take being lonely and constantly failing at everything i try
1,lately i have been going to sleep later and later into the day just so i can avoid ppl and avoid dealing with depressionbeing sad but by the time i do wake upcannot sleep anymore i feel more depressed than when i originally was and yet despite all of that i still have this need to sleep excessively because i keep having dreams that are more entertaining adventurous and exciting than what is currently going on in my life and even when i rewire my sleep schedule back to normal i still end up going back to the messed up sleep schedule just because i hate feeling depressed and hate dealing with it
0,well i finally got around to trying out this blogger even though i have had the google toobar for ages and was a loyal googler long before that silly me i first tried to blog with a different blogger site and to tell you the truth i did not like the feel oh it was simple enough if awkward but the home page of the blogging site was so darn busy i felt lost there this place is so much better i should have gone with what i knew was a tried and true service anyways this is my dumping ground stuff i find on the internet that i must squawk about good and bad late night frustrations and nightmares and the occasional proud parenting moment or self flaggellation over same all will be posted here so i can embarrass my family and bore strangers i hope you will drop in occasionally
1,my birthday and no one remembered i wish i could skip today so i have to feel so terrible no one ever notices me i could never hold a candle to anyone else just going to go to sleep edit i expect so many people to care about me and it honestly made me feel a lot better about myself today thank you so much for all the wishes

1,what would you do what do you do when your depressions effects you so much to the point you do not eat or you over eat you do not sleep or you over sleep you do not talk to anyone or pretend to want to be around people what do you do when your depression does not allow you to be motivated and takes away all the enjoyment from your life that makes you happy removing music dancing and laughing in replace for dark rooms teary eyes and silence what do you do when you will not answer your phone being that only the bill collector is calling because you are not able to pay the credit that is pilling up that helps you survive being that you cannot work or cannot make money because of no interest too because of lack of motivation because the thoughts running through your head being that you cannot talk to anyone or that you will not or that you are disappointed or that you feel like a burden now your phones off and there is no call but the collector is there no text this shit is not fair so what is next social media you can make it or it can break you driving you to want to do the very thing you try not to think of day by day because you do not know what to do what would you do
1,how to function properly when you realize there is no such thing as life i am depressed but i have no sad story to tell just an uneventful one i fail at everything and turn everyone down mostly because i was tormented for years by the absurdity of it all i do not care if me dying will affect anyone someones recovery from depression does not concern me neither we are just complex preprogrammed machines creating illusions to survive and reproduce to seek pleasure according to the program we are part of the universe and shit cool so what it is not even about the pain anymore why keep going when life does not exist but if i do stay for a while how do i even function properly when i am stuck with this in mind
1,wish i could fucking cry tbh i have never felt less like a human being
1,i lost a friend i just graduated high school and all throughout high school i have struggled with depression and anxiety at my school there was this really cute girl who i had a crush on she was in two of my classes and i got know her pretty well although she was kind of out of my league and i could tell she was not into me romantically i never minded just being her friend because she is really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school it made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when i was with her i would totally forget about all that stuff unfortunately sometime towards the end of the school year she started dating another guy and after that she did not really seem interested in being my friend now it is summer and i have tried to keep in touch with her i send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open i hate seeing pictures of them together i want to tell her how i feel and that i wish i could be her friend still but i am worried it will just create a bad situation i really do not know what to do
1,getting motivated to get help i was diagnosed with a mood disorder and ptsd years ago i was getting help for a while but i dropped out of school and moved out of state so i just have not been able to do that in the past year i live with and mooch off of an so but i have been fairly isolated for about months i have been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when i started working now all i do is this stupid parttime job i should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal it is all so superficial it does not feel beneath me but i really just do not mesh with it anyway health insurance i cannot figure out how to fill out the income stuff a hospital near me has people that can help but i just cannot find the motivation to even call them it is like i am trying to prevent myself from getting help it is not even just psychiatric reasons that i want health insurance i have a referral for a neurologist i have been having memory issues twitches etc i know i will not go without insurance i probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a i know i will not be taken seriously and b the only thing i genuinely like about myself is my mind so that is the priority i am not completely not trying i will take st johns wort if i am persistently suicidal but it does not help with motivation i have been going to support groups i will decide to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before i get out of the door play music leave my phone behind so i do not get sidetracked tell people what i am doing so i feel pressured to keep my word incentivize with promises of fast food caffeine or chocolate i do not know what else to do i cannot even tell if it is laziness or depression or something else the only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting
1,music has a huge effect on my moods music has a huge effect on my moods i have been having an okay day with a good amount of anxiety and my depression has not been so strong the depression is not of course gone it is just not as bad today i was listening to this song that i like which is ironic but it is a pretty sad song it triggered me and made me really sad and made my depression worse i was thinking of my abuse my relationship with my girlfriend and other things during it i was thinking of a lot of things and then my mood flipped is anyone okay messaging me to talk i can support you too if you want
1,honestly i do not know if it is worth it anymore i wake up there is only fucking trouble and chaos around me all of my family members are suffering from anxiety and depression things only look worse by the day my dad told us how he does not care if he dies tomorrow on christmas eve i do not know maybe this post is coming out as confusing or chaotic but the reality is i do not know if it is worth holding it or living anymore i am not suicidal but i need to fucking vent because i am fucking going crazy i cannot fucking sleep at night and when i do i feel fucking sad the whole fucking day i fucking hate myself all this shit because we cannot fucking return home and we are here because is ny fucking fault fuck this shit and every fucking time i am around people i just do not know why i put on this fucking mask a fucking emotional mask i pretend like i am happy and i am having fun when really i am fucking dying on the inside i am tired i am fucking tired of living i am tired of money i am tired of problems the only thing i want right now is a pack of cigs and absolute silence and peace so there there is my fucking rant sorry for all the fucks

0,well now that kerry selected a running mate the election will start heating up my support goes towards are current and great president however i am a little worried about his chances everywhere i turn i hear how so many people hate him he is constantly getting bashed everywhere you go and for some reason other than talk shows the gop is not fighting back this was the same mistake his dad made and i think this election is too important to lose to someone who has yet to take a stand on any of the major issues hey kerry we know you would not have sent troops but we are there now so what would you do now if you were in office all i can tell people is to actually look at facts instead of read opinions and at least make an informed decision
1,the good times do not make the bad times worth living people always act like it is worth living through bad times so you can experience the good times but to me it does not feel worth it even the good times are tainted and i can barely ever even enjoy them the way i am supposed to they barely even make it into the picture when i think about my life

1,well i bought the tens machine got it set up earlier and decided i was in so much pain across my shoulders that i would set it at the neck shoulder setting and on the most intense setting due to the pain and the desperation i was feeling well that was a mistake it has like being stabbed with a pointy stick so i reset it to the minimum setting it has helped a little perhaps i should use it more often to a get used to the feeling b get rid of the pain as i am in less pain now but it has not gone altogether would i recommend one let us just say i need a few more days to decide but for now i am in slightly less pain than i was
0,wow is not it wierd how you think you are really good friends with someone then all of a sudden they are in a bad mood so they decide to be rude i hate moody friends it is like what is the point of keeping them you never know from one day to the next if they are even going to like you one day they are the nicest person in the world the next you cannot do a damn thing right some of my friends are like that one in particular and sometimes people decide to follow
0,my father and stepmother sound like they will be getting a divorce i have three half siblings whom i am relatively close to two of them are teenagers and still under their parents care anyways long story short it is my fathers consumption of alcohol that is causing the damage he does well for awhile then does not and it is been going on like this for years unfortunately my father and i are not that close it almost feels like we are walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family he seems distant to everyone in our family as well it can be hard for him to open up i think my father is really depressed but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that he may be going through some sort of late midlife crises right now he still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family my stepmother took me aside and looked worried about her situation she expressed that she may need to get legal help and is concerned about protecting her children at this point i am going to try and open up to my dad and just point blank ask him what is going on with his life he is about to lose his wife of years and hit a hard rock bottom i hate to see him do this as he is been a pretty good dad overall and always provided for his family at least keeping our heads above water financially any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help i know it is gotta be on his terms and everything but i do not know what else to do thanks

1,my life is so hollow stupid self pitying rant sorry nobody cares about my existence never been and get into a relationship stuck in this isolated suburb for the next years of my life drifting between my school and home usually i can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life going to have once free but recently been having to do more school work used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently been having to actually work to compete with my peers and i either reject it to stay in my dream world or get minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is nothing feels authentic when here there have been beautiful times in my life and of them are when been abroad i just feel so genuinely empty whenever i give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated i am from people and the world and as a person who truly appreciates the beauty of human beings and life this really hurts me
1,when i was twelve one of my younger sisters got leukemia despite my failing memory i can still remember a lot of what happened back then i can remember being picked up at the park where i was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested you could say i was whisked away from my innocence but you are pretentious and i am not i can remember how my mother broke the news to me and how her voice cracked a little when i asked how bad she had it i can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparents place where i was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital speaking to my cousin and saying that i felt it was somehow my fault what followed was roughly a year of total disruption my sister became the focus understandably while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing but that has mostly been forgotten not blocked away just forgotten it was another age and does not feel real anymore in the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of expatients and their families tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview i had been avoiding it mostly because i am lazy and i only ever seem to do things that i feel will be enjoyable to me anyway so they called through and i spoke i do not think there were really any surprises although it was bizarre when i became conscious to the fact that i occurred to her getting cancer as it or that i think i only said cancer once in the entire interview does that mean i am crazy struggling to cope i do not know of the questions they asked i do not think i answered any that would because a worry
0,should i let my brother live with us not sure if this is the right place or if another sub is better but here goes i have a brother turning this year who lives with my parents my parents sold their house and have not yet decided where to live they are and and are retired we own a small apartment building and live in it and rent the units my parents will have some cash and also have monthly income but my brother appears to be very depressed may also have some untreated medical issues and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs not pain pills but xanax amp ativan not sure he seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job which is doing over other peoples houses as a contractor he owns his own truck and tools my parents are worried they will lose him when they move if he does not move with them but nobody knows what to do or what his real problems are is it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brothers rent by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry andor other requirements has anyone done this is there another sub that is better for these types of questions i do not know if anyone knows what to do anymore my mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist though he is very manipulative and secretive so i do not know what to do or if anything else can be done and i am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internisthe is very deceptive i do not even know if there is a name for what he does
1,i am a year old man with a history of depression i was diagnosed when i was and of standing apart not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion but not fitting in simply because i could not i have never been married i have had only one long term relationship it was long distance and very turbulent for both my partner and i the relationship ended three years ago to this day i wonder why i do not measure up why i cannot seem to find my place in life while not physically stunning by any means i never thought i was hideous either though my looks have most often been pointed out to me as a shortcoming so that is the explanation i tend to go with most of the time when i hit my teenage years panic disorder became a problem too as i realized how little control i had over my life and the way it was going to turn out at the beginning of each year i stand back and take stock of my situation asking myself where am i right now which direction am i headed in from here what are my options up until now i could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful to keep going but this year i cannot i have been out of work for a long time the panic attacks are getting bad again i have had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problems in the last few months and worst of all after so many years i am still alone there are no prospects out there no one wants to be with me i am in a lot of pain and i do not know how to make it better this is not just a temporary slump it is my whole life but it hurts even worse now than it used to

1,glad i can help firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room that is where most of my posts are i have never really posted my story but for what it is worth here it is i live in northern new york state where i grew up on the family farm my brother and i run a feedhardwarefarm supply store i have got a terrific wife and two daughters ages and my depression hit in january during a bout with the flu my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge my nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue but i had had an extremely stressful six months between job illness and adoption i am also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression so i guess depression should not have been so big a surprise but it was i am a happy person with a great life but i feel like i have been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at hell now i am doing everything i can to ensure i do not relapse but i actually think i am a better person having been through this i am much more appreciative of a good day and i am much more attuned to the suffering of others it is amazing how many people i know have similar problems and i hate that it has to be this way but suffering does bring me closer to god i hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was worth it the memory of the anguish is still too vivid and besides it could come back tomorrow but right now today i feel more contented with my crazy precious stupid dear wasted amazing life than i have been in years i am very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time and to have a supportive family that did not tell me to snap out of it and i am very lucky to have the people here in this forum who know what it is like i hope tvk that in a few weeks you too will be a recovering depression survivor till then we are here when you need us
0,some days i feel so bloody old it is the way i remenisce over old times and experiences i had when i was younger and i think it is the fact that i do this so oftern is what makes me feel like a bit of a dinosaur maybe i am being overly aware of the changes that have occurred over the last few years i am and that is really nothing in the scheme of things but i had such a crazy time from that i cannot help but sometimes feel in awe of the times i have had i imagine alot of us go through it but i seem to be the only who keeps talking about it i think i am a narcissist i think i think about what i think about way too much am i overly concerned with the way i perceive myself why do i always have to feel good about every situation even when i am with a person when we part i always feel the need to make the parting smooth and clean no awkward goodbyes and whatnot but then i think that because i am already anticipating the situation that makes it awkward anybody else ever feel like that why do i always have to find the things that i think are wrong with me and then make a strategy of how im going to combat and resolve those inequities how good it would feel to say i am selfish i smoke too much pot i am cheap i always need things to be even and that is how i am done no plan no outline to correct my traits gone awry i bet people live like that it must be fucking great and very freeing we took grandma out for lunch today to celebrate her birthday i wrote on her card p s you do not look a day over i thought it was rather clever and tongue in cheek for a variety of reasons in fact i thought it funner to say as opposed to seeing as is such a stretch it is not conceivable either way i do not think grandma got it oh we better not let anyone see this was her response shit then i felt like an asshole and even when were at lunch i kept thinking about how uncool it was and i could not shake the feeling that everything was not perfect and smooth aya gram gave me a slew of goodies and i have finally got something from the family to hold onto thank god

1,this message is especially for newcomers desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this a year ago i was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out i was attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and miserable hours in the nut house they put me on remeron which helped a little taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts but little else weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hopes of getting better were dwindling then one day my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the cbt many of you have tried cbt to no avail i sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly hard enough and or long enough when retraining the mind it is vitally important to diligently apply cbt daily for several weeks see my webpage for more info antidepressant that works once this becomes a regular habit i am confident you will see improvement as i did i am positive you can do it too it was the toughest job i have ever had to do but it sure was worth it whenever a negative situation presents itself now i just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically it is hard in the beginning but it is totally do able plus it gets easier after awhile then once it becomes automatic you do not even have to think about it properly applied cbt helps tremendously but it is not a complete cure as you will see in my story you must also take care of your body because it is what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients the two go hand in hand the brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitters while the body provides the brain with the proper chemicals to do its job leisure activities help also i know it is difficult for some of you to have fun but it is important to get your mind off your problems even if just for a little while i mention motivation in my story sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what is good for you even if you do not want to contrary to what many believe motivation begins with action not visa versa the sooner you begin to properly apply the techniques i learned and the more effort you put in to them the sooner you will get better hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy so try to put them aside for a month as you get on the road to wellness i have been off antidepressants for almost a year now i feel great plus my concentration and comprehension are back march marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too i am basically drug free and am as happy as i was years ago before the depression nearly ruined my life

0,this title is more of what i am looking for than what i am offering i was looking for a way to start some good conversations on this topic but was unsure as to where i should go to do so until now so that is what i am wondering personally i think that for the most part the church has missed the point over the last years or so but this has become more evident in recent years as illustrated by this excerpt from blue like jazz in a recent radio interview i was sternly asked by the host who did not consider himself a christian to defend christianity i told him that i do it and moreover that i want to do defend the term he asked me if i was a christian and i told him yes why you want to defend he asked confused i told him i no longer knew what the term meant of the hundreds of thousands of people listening to his show that day some of them had terrible experiences with christianity they may have been yelled at by a teacher in a christian school abused by a minister or browbeaten by a christian parent to them the term christianity meant something that no christian i know would defend by fortifying the term i am only making them more and more angry i do it stop ten people on the street and ask them what they think of when they hear the word christianity and they will give you ten different answers how can i defend a term that means ten different things to ten different people i told the radio show host that i would rather talk about jesus and how i came to believe that jesus exists and that he likes me the host looked back at me with tears in his eyes when we were done he asked me if we could go get lunch together he told me how much he like christianity but how he had always wanted to believe jesus was the son of god i am not saying that i disagree with the teaching of jesus nor with that of the bible but rather with the fundamental ringwing christianity of the century what are your thoughts on christian spirituality

1,hi i am new to the forums i was going to lurk for a bit before i posted but there is so many of us i mean i knew but i did not know you know it seems like the thing to do i am a year old male and i have had problems with depression for as long as i can remember though it is become worse over the last year or so i was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years but i am no longer motivated to do either i am still going to school though hi i am new to the forums i was going to lurk for a bit before i posted but there is so many of us i mean i knew but i did not know you know it seems like the thing to do i am a year old male and i have had problems with depression for as long as i can remember though it is become worse over the last year or so i was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years but i am no longer motivated to do either i am still going to school though i have no real direction and i am afraid that my lack of motivation is going to because me to screw that up too i started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and they have increased in frequency the last few months they are not to sound melodramatic the hardest thing i have ever had to deal with if i am in panicattack mode any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a lifethreatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes as ridiculous as that sounds it is absolutely real when it is happening and i live in almost constant fear it is going to happen again i have a hard time even driving anymore especially on the freeway and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store she is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong though i do not think she understands to what extent i have started completely avoiding any situation in which i have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people i do not know on the phone these symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last months or so and exponentially for the last weeks i just lost my job it seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer and i am sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive but its already getting to the point where i know i cannot handle living like this for years on end i have suffered from depression for relative to my age a long time and the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying a little redundant i know it feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart i guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help i do not have health insurance anymore and i am not sure where to go from here i have been medicated in the past but i have not taken anything in a few years though without insurance i am not even sure that is an option that is enough for now thanks for providing a resource like this the anonymity of the internet let us me say some of the things i am afraid to say to everyone else
0,friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke ok so i had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist it was not a big deal therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting however i told my friend that my therapist fancied me etc whilst things were happening i told her to promise to keep it a secret even if i died nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together but things were a bit weird i guess some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job anyway i pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor in the convo i told them my friend referred to him as daddy nick behind his back it was merely a joke and i did not really message the tutor any of this she freaked out when i sent her the photoshopped convo and her immediate response was i am going to ruin your therapists life for this i told her it was a joke and a prank she demanded evidence which i gave her she then acted as though things were fine when they were not she said if i ever do anything like that again she will ruin my therapists life i feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off she then asked me how my rabbit is doing like i want to speak to her now am i doing the right thing for wanting to ignore her and even removing her from my life

1,i am a year old female who has suffered from depression for the last years i remember having bouts of it in high school hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless but it generally passed and things got better then all of a sudden when i was i just started crying constantly feeling out of control wanting to dig a hole and bury myself not knowing what to do with myself feeling hysterical i went on medication after a few months and things improved but it is something i still deal with every day i am at university full time as well as working part time and just feel like i am constantly on the edge of going insane i just moved to a new city and feel so lonely wanting attention but i feel like no ones interested worst of all i miss so much university because i cannot get out of bed in the morning that my tutors regard me as a bad student which makes me feel so bad because i know i am smarter than most of the people in our class i just want everyone to know i am not lazy and boring i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning i have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great but it is so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage which makes me even more stressed out i do not want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse i really love my course and it is pretty much the only thing that gives me joy if only i could get out of bed to go i am so angry at myself my life was not meant to be like this
1,can we talk about personal hygiene or lack of there of i really even remember the last time i showered and not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch i just want to i mean i like feeling dirty or like i smell bad but the thought of getting in the shower bathing washing my face getting out putting lotion on etc just sounds like to much work the most i can do is brush my teeth but other than that i lay in bed i mean i can get up to do things that i like on a good day like painting but for the most part i lay in bed all day i want to feel like a nasty bitch of that an girl but at the same time i feel like i help it i also want to feel like using this as an excuse to be nasty but i just just a rant because i usually see a lot of people talking about it

1,standing in the rain standing in the rain letting the clouds cry your pain your own tears do not pour no one checks in anymore a fraud seeking attention in reality you are quietly seeking intervention there has no knocks on your door no one checks in anymore take a long walk down the lane and stand alone in the rain you hate yourself for being sick the minds candle burning at both ends of the wick you are losing your grip on what matters on what is sane but none of that really matters when you stand in the rain how long can you play this game before you fall into shame and pain who knows so today let us just stand in the rain because tomorrow might not be the same this is probably terrible but i have got too much free time and my mind being idle is very bad

0,how to disown my sister how do i remove my year old sister from the family her younger brother and all my life my sister has been nothing but manipulative towards my parents the main issue is when she turns my mom and dad against each other resulting in her being free to do whatever while our parents scream at each other leading to my mom crying or then separating for a few days this the first time happened which is why taking into serious consideration of kicking her out of our family i understand my sister means a lot to me so it be easy but her behavior have made my mom cry more times than i can count unfortunately my parents are also very soft on her so they will not go along with me trying to disown her i understand some people might think a terrible person but i have lost a lot of respect for my sister where this seems to be the only option i appreciate all advice

0,i saw leif yesterday for those of you who do not know he used to be my old roommate and a good friend of mine until he tried to rip me off anyway he could with rent and bills he also lied to me every opportunity he got and then he had the audacity to tell ryan that i lie all the time about everything i really could care less if i ever see him again anyway i was walking through the mall with ryan and her mom yesterday and he and his daughter were looking at purses i saw him and i tried to get away from him without him noticing me it did not work yeah that is right adam you just keep on walking he said okay i responded and i kept on walking he responded with shmuck and then he saw ryan and said hey baby how are you i guess he still likes her i have no idea i really hope that is the last time i see him but i doubt it is a few weeks ago ryan and i were driving back to her house and when we got to her street he was driving past us we turned around to see if that was him and he turned around and drove past us again we turned down another street to get back to her house he passed us again each time he covered his face and jennifer another former roommate of ours who is now dating leif covered her face so i guess we would not recognize her we never saw him again that day but is he stalking me now was he just bored so he got his two kids and girlfriend in the car and set out to find me will i ever be rid of this guy last night i got home and belinda my roommate for another month was in the kitchen she was leaving to go stay at a friends house for the night but before she left she told me that my room smelled bad she blamed it on my shoes or trash in my trash can she told me i needed to get some candles or an air freshener this caused a fight it was our first fight since moving into the place last august the only thing that i smell in my room is the air freshener that she put into my room a month ago that smells horrible my shoes are brand new and therefore do not stink the only trash i have in my room is paper my room is the only room in the house that actually smells good the rest of the house smells like her sausage and slim jims anyway i cleaned my room last night and hopefully she will be happy now i only have three more weeks left in this place and after that i will not have to deal with this anymore
1,does anyone else get very irritable whenever you are hungry the biggest problem in my life is that i get extremely irritable when i am hungry i will find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kind of snap out of it and realize i am actually just hungry then i get something to eat and i can feel some of the stress melting away taking deep breaths and shit this happens every day this makes me pretty cranky while i am making something to eat in the kitchen if anyone tries to talk to me i just want nothing to do with them until i get some food in me it is putting a real strain on some of my relationships i am struggling with this because it is really hard to balance not overeating with not being irritable i do not really know what is going on
1,looking for an opinion so i have been angry for awhile now and i feel like my anger is unjustified a few weeks i told one of my close friends that i had feelings for her and i also told her i wanted some space to get over these feelings this is because i could not be with her she has a significant other soon after she would not talk to me at all and she avoided me all of her friends told me that i should not have done that because it was a bad thing to do i just wanted to tell her that i wanted some space from her so i could no longer have feelings for her since then all of her friends have treated me with aggression and insults i get dismissed every time i am around her and all of her friends this has launched me into another depressive episode i was yelled at by other people and ostracized i was thinking that what i did was not so bad but maybe i am wrong i feel like a bad person i know this probably ridiculous but i have also feel like killing myself because being ostracized and dismissed is one of my fears i have social phobia

0,annoyed and i feel absolutely horrible about it my parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state a little over a year ago my father found a job back in the state where i currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works as much as i love my parents though sometimes i really struggle with sharing my limited space i e a very small one bedroom apartment what makes it even more difficult is the fact that i rarely ever know ahead of time when he is coming and when he is not and when he does come he does not knock he just walks right in using the spare key that i came home to find was gone without first being asked if it was okay to take a while back it honestly makes me feel like i am twelve again i worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now i do not i had not even been on my own for a year when all of this started i cannot say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying you will be fine we are family and the one time i even indirectly said something to my father just by casually asking if he had taken my spare key i got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with long story short i do not know what to do i feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation but i am

0,hey all just felt that i needed a change so i have deleted all previous posts they were boring anyway my grandmother is in the hospital again she is been puking and having dizzy spells and the doctors do not know exactly what is wrong with her so much for modern technology read the da vinci code by dan brown interesting book it argues that jesus was not divine and that the church invented his divinity also argues that jesus was married to mary magdalene well i am not going to go in depth to argue anything but i think dan brown made lots of mistakes in his assumptions for example he writes that peter was the one in the picture the last supper who was making threatening gestures apparently that man is judas iscariot not simon peter that explains a lot about the hand gestures anyways there is a reason why the book is under the fiction section in book shops and libraries thinking of getting a new cpu thinking of you too bye all
1,how to deal with people who cannot seem to be bothered with you question is fairly selfexplanatory i ask this because recently within the past or so months my supposed friends have started to become quite distant with me and it is making me feel like total crap they rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times it is all very fragmented what hurts the most is i see them interacting with their other friends on facebook etc and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages my friends used to be great they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc but now i feel like i have been replaced and i have nobody left even back when i would hang out with them they would be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and i feel so hurt being alone sucks no matter what i can never seem to make friends with anyone new the majority of other people my age are living it up but i cannot seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family i feel like i am missing out on something i feel so unwanted to the point i have started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more it is beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back as much as i hate to admit it i do not know whether to take this opportunity to improve myself and pursue my own hobbies and basically just do things on my own or attempt to reconnect with my friendsactively seek out people who will appreciate me anyone have any advice to get me out of this rut and to feel less shit about wasting my youth words of wisdom previous similar experiences etc

1,i am not really sure what i want to say here i was sexually abused by my brother from the age of until i was about he hung himself when i was i am now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life i never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result i suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation i am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons i came off my depression anxiety medications i felt they were stopping me from really feeling and i felt i needed to be fully aware of my feeling in order to work through this and be able to let go at the moment i do not see an end to all this
1,i want to kill myself a lot these days just so disconnected from everything and everyone i meet new people and it is making me hate my life the only girls i meet are through work and rather keep these relationships professional girls i meet other ways never last and i know how to stop talking to them always holding onto the shred of hope that we will pick up where we left off when i know this going to happen i let go of the relationships that work because i am unable to create new ones alone as ever been i even have guy friends because bad with competition i even realize it all subconscious an asshole and just been a dick to people who just deserve it been so selfish i guess i can be happy that started to make changes they say change your habits and your mind will follow well improved my habits greatly over the past year so why am i still a piece of shit why am i still unable to let go of the failed relationships why am i unable to move forward from all this
0,i might have to go to the hospital and get the evil stupid injection on my arm its not nice i know its going to break like three of my arms and the pain will not leave till i eat off all the arms no i am not making sence yea and i have done pretty much nothing during the two weeks in japan although i was going to have the best summer holiday ever its the most boring summer holiday i have ever spent its hot it stinks its hot it sucks its hot it boers me so its not nice i think i am forgeting my english and its also not gooooood cuz i have to go back to school at the end of august and i am supposed to be able to speak english like mad and get good grades on the work i do in english oh well ill say to my mom that i want to move to esl so i can be with those stupid freaks from japan who think they are good at english and i actually can kill both of them oops the topic has kind of changed and i cannot be bothered to look back and think what i was talking about
1,i do not act depressed so people just think i am edgy trade mark i am pretty good at keeping up appearances in public but i do make the occasional depression joke so when i tell those jokes or share a meme about suicide people think i am making light of depression or laughing at suicidal people but honestly i cannot remember the last time i went a day without wanting to kill myself haha but then again you cannot really reach out to anyone without being that depressing friend and the college therapist is pretty shit so here i ammmmmmmm
1,i find myself hating birthdays and christmas now those are the times when surrounded by friends and feel loved i get that so i find myself starting to hate it and i feel bad about feeling this way i feel bad that the one who seem to smile and laugh when everyone else around me can do it just fine i feel bad that the one at school known for never smiling that must be why no one tries to talk to me
1,there truly is no hope for any of us this is the bleakest truth of all everything is more complicated than you think you only see a tenth of what is true there are a million little strings attached to every choice you make you can destroy your life every time you choose but maybe you will not know for twenty years and you may never ever trace it to its source and you only get one chance to play it out just try and figure out your own divorce and they say there is no fate but there is it is what you create and even though the world goes on for eons and eons you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born but while alive you wait in vain wasting years for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right and it never comes or it seems to but it does not really and so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along something to make you feel connected something to make you feel whole something to make you feel loved and the truth is i feel so angry and the truth is i feel so fucking sad and the truth is i have felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long i have been pretending i am ok just to get along just for i do not know why maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery because they have their own well fuck everybody
1,i was not supposed to live this long i tried to kill myself on my birthday january but failed because i vomited up all of the drain cleaner i drank they kept me in a psych ward for a week i just came back home and it is kind of surreal given that i packed all my shit up and wrapped up most loose ends the only feeling i can compare this to is like beating an openworld game and just wandering around with nothing left to do honestly i am prepared to die but am not willing to overcome my instinctual fear of death again

0,i am lost without her but i do not know what to do so me and my best friend of about years stopped talking and being friends essentially around a year ago we had been fighting a bit before and it kind of led up to this so what kind of started it off was the fact she got a new boyfriend who was and i swear still is the biggest jerk of all time i can see now that it probably was not my place to tell her that but i was only looking out for her and she used to appreciate advice like that from me in the past then she started pretty much ditching me for him and taking his side and telling him things that were private and i felt like she was slowly kicking me out and replacing me and i told her that but she did not see it because she had her new guy and it was kind of like she did not care because she had someone there for her she also lost a couple other friends before this happened pretty much due to the same reasons so i did not feel that bad at first because i was kind of like you know she did this to herself she made this choice but now i really miss her and i hate that we stopped being friends because i kind of need her i am not sure what to do she did actually text me about a month after we stopped talking and was like hey i know we do not talk anymore but i wanted to see how you are going and i actually ignored it because i was angry and did not care but now i kind of see it was a bitch move and i do not know how to text her or talk again because its awkward and she is still with this guy and i am pretty sure he hates me and i juts do not know how to handle it but i really want to make this right again any help would be really appreciated

0,i am trying to understand a couple of things of wildly different importance first post is baseball major league baseballs insistence that their allstar game decide which league receives the privelege of home field advantage in the world series is ridiculous this policy blows my mind there are so many inequities in allowing a collection of individuals from different teams to come together and decide an important postseason rule such as home field advantage first of all as evidenced by last nights debacle one persons failure can crush an entire leagues hopes roger clemens comes in and lays an egg and the next thing you know the national league does not have a chance this years example is particularly strange since a l batters came into the game with the luxury of having faced clemens multiple most n l hitters could not say about their encounter with mark mulder to start the game also because of mlbs insistence that at least one player from each team be represented players with no real vested interest in which league gets home field advantage are deciding the outcome i doubt livan hernandez is particularly concerned with the postseason this year so if he faces someone like derek jeter the stakes are unequal to the point of unfairness another thing about all of the this time it counts garbage is the fact that the game is still played like an exhibition if the game is really supposed to count then i want barry bonds in for the whole game i do not want roger clemens pitching on a couple hours of sleep because of all of his allstar festivity obligations i want mike piazza not johnny estrada no offense to the promising young catcher trying to make up a deficit i mean i am a cubs fan they have a chance to play in the world series and it makes a huge difference to the club and fans alike whether more games are played at wrigley field but that point is moot because the allstar game is supposed to be an exhibition what would be the point of naming estrada as an allstar if he did not get a chance to play it is all just stupid it is an idea that never should have been let out of the think tank baseball should take a page from the nba and nfl the team with the best regular season record gets home field advantage it is pretty simple really

0,should i reach out to her or leave it alone tldr i had a friend and it ended pretty bad imo really missed her over the past couple years and i thought about rebefriending her but not sure start with the good things about our past friendship she was pretty sweet to me very supportive of most things she stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a foot bright orange mohawk she tried to keep me from dating a pretty toxic boy but at the time i was young and listen she made me walk around the entire town with her frequently helped me lose the weight gained and build some muscle in my legs she was for the most part a great friend now the bad since i listen about toxic boy we ended up dating for about years said he like her because when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie now while not going to go into the semantics of whether or not it was s assault in anyway i will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we accept her apology and to she borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when i was young when i wanted them back she claimed she find them almost a year went by of her for them and i told her mostly from toxic boy pushing me to if she find them by the end of the week i was going to call the police and report her for stealing them she gave them back to me a couple days later scratched though i know if she knew they were scratched i also shortly dated and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year our personalities really mix well but i think she holds it against me the manority of us breaking up was due to toxic boy he was toxic he tried to fuck literally any girl friend i introduced him to pushing me into breaking up with her telling me she was the toxic one because she support our relationship and because of the juvie thing from years before in she reached out to me on facebook saying i know your probably the last person you want to hear from but i just wanted to say i am sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school if you do not want to be friends that is understandable just know that is not me anymore and i am which of course toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died so i need a second strangers opinion what do i do tldr toxic now ex boyfriend made me ditch abrasive friend do i rekindle friendship

1,according to the mental health nurse i am not depressed so since october i have been or at least thought i had been depressed i dropped out of school started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things i spent nearly the whole of at home doing nothing because i simply could not i got a full time job in september but i hated it and it made me worse and i had to quit after i started self harming again and have been cutting up until now i am by the way if that has important things have been getting worse again recently i am cutting almost every night and feel down and just cannot do anything i do not even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon however i was hopeful for today as i was going to see a new nurse who i was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me i was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i am i am classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services so as soon as i met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year i told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is you am not depressed she said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and i was not cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i had been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before i have also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others i told her the only friends i have ever had was the friends i have made years ago when i first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like i have great social skills as i have been able to make friends it honestly felt like she was not listening to a single word i was saying as i said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it also i should add i am in the uk so this is with the nhs so i am not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that has was i need i am sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i am complaining i just wanted other peoples opinions on this as i just do not know what to think

1,yep i know this all too well and it is a sad state of affairs but you are aware of it best you know what is going on than be surprised sn i hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now and i hope you do not have to go i will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time but while you are praying and hoping consider the issue of your personal power if you are feeling shaky in other areas of life i doubt that you feel that you have any i have been in that situation over many things remember the difference between what you do have control over and what you do not have control over you can control the way you approach this job your punctuality your diligence your politeness to other workers you cannot control the decisions made on the top and how they will affect your status i have been reading a book called corporate confidential by cynthia shapiro she was an hr manager for her whole life and spills the beans on how companies decide who will stay and who will go it was an eyeopener for me perhaps it can help you at this juncture in your own prayers remember to ask god not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control when you are in a phase of instability it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way but a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone elses sea propels you into action that turning point came for me about years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected i felt a power i had never felt before the ability to take charge of my own life not waiting for someone elses decision to tell me whether i was going to be ok or not i am trying to find my way back to that point i hope you do too it can happen
1,i felt happy the other day and now i am worse off i went on a date the other night my first one in a very very long time it went surprisingly well and the guy was really sweet and understanding the whole date i felt the overwhelming sense of loneliness i struggle with disappear my mind was clear and i was able to be quick witted funny and upbeat i was happy for the first time in ages now that it is over i feel worse off i forgot what it feels like to not be crushed by depression and all the shitty things that come with it the depression has seeped right back in and it hurts more now i should be grateful i was able to escape it for a moment but fuck no i almost wish i did not have to be reminded of what normal felt like
1,i have not felt anything in over a month i have struggled with depression for a few years now and i was doing really well i met a girl online that seemed absolutely perfect and she made me feel truly happy for the first time since i was little in october she just stopped replying to me she sent a message a few weeks later faking to be a family member and lied about committing suicide i just feel nothing anymore after that
0,am i being paranoid i joined girl crew a few months ago for those who do not know it is basically an app for women to make friends a few of us girls met up twice and have a group chat we are planning to go to a rally tomorrow and we all expressed our interest in getting a drink afterwards two of the girls taggedmentioned the others in the group in something on fb places to go for drinks both times i was not mentioned despite saying that i would like to go so am i being paranoid or do i have a right to be upset rationally i should not be we do not know each other that well so they cannot hate me yet but i do not know i did not make the best first impression so maybe they do not want to be near me at all i might not even go tomorrow i might remove myself from the group chatdelete them off fb what should i do
1,i am going to die a virgin no one likes me and i have no friends my masculinity selfesteem and sense of selfworth have been destroyed thoroughly and are simply nonexistent anymore i do not even bother trying anymore i just wallow in my own sadness and escapist entertainment trying to find a reason to continue living with the fact that i am worthless no woman would ever be into me and i am going to die a virgin i cannot even find solace in masturbation because whenever i see any sort of porn i go deep into a depression again because seeing two people enjoying each other makes me envious i have no friends and now i do not think i can make any i cannot make friends with people i do not know how to do anything right man
0,trying to repair a lost friendship first time poster here so sorry if i explain things very well so a few months ago i went on a trip with my friend and both of our boyfriends i got a little controlling with the planning of the trip and that caused some tension and after they went to a party they want us accompanying them to i got upset and distanced myself a little this lead to her boyfriend and i having an argument where he stated if i a girl after this we spoken but the friend recently contacted my mother to check in on how she was with some local flooding this has made me think that she still cares for me and i still greatly care for her having trouble approaching how to contact her and while i know that it was said in anger i feel like i deserve an apology from her boyfriend or at least reassurance that he ever actually attack me is it unreasonable to want an apology from him should i let it go i feel i should also note i do have sever anxiety why i struggle with situations like these so much
1,a rant i guess i had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing i am finally off of them and i cannot take this i did not think they were working and i definitely was not where i wanted to be when i was at my maximum dose but oh my god i started them for anxiety mostly so i am surprised that i am relapsing so hard into depression i just wish i did not exist eh better yet i wish i did not have to participate in every day life i do not know what to do i used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now i have none i have finals that start tomorrow that i have not studied for at all like not even a little and somehow i do not care that is just not like me i am exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time i exhausted from being stressed all the time i do not want to keep doing this i just want to sleep and to think i have four more years ahead of me i do not know what i am going to do i already feel like a failure i keep thinking that maybe i could find something to take my mind off things but i have no hobbies i do not enjoy anything any more not even eating which i used to love probably too much but hey i want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me i do not want to have to keep trying another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now the smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral three weeks ago if i spilled my coffee i would have laughed it off it happened the other day and i cried for hours and was so angry three weeks ago i was better than this and i am crashing all of a sudden i do not know how i am going to study for my finals and maintain my gpa to keep my scholarships i am fucked probably my therapist is not that great and i have not seen her in awhile and i do not have money to go back to her my psych appointment is not until late january after my medical procedure i just want to be happy and have some motivation for fucks sake

0,god it seems like no matter how hard i try there is nothing right in this world for me to hang on to everything is so fubar what i would not give to just go back to italy everything here in the states is so arrogant and so brisque i suppose it does not really help that i am in the middle of nowhere but still the people of napoli were better and they did not give me the troubles that women here do no matter what i cannot seem to decide m with her amazing beauty and sweet innocence as opposed to n with her attractive playfullness and obvious willingness or b who i could have for as long as i wanted to be there with a hug and with support and to love me but with intimacy extending only as far a kiss at the end of a date how do i decide what is more important
1,i have lost marines to depression and almsost lost a none saw combat i need help understanding hi i just had my funeral in years for yet another marine a few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down these marines as far as i can tell suffe from depression pretty much every one of them was intelligent like way too smart for the marine corps and each of them stood out as the funny one to say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement the marine corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal marines but all our training videos depict some clearly distressed person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves in reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help what i am asking as someone who has never suffered depression i have been depressed but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me i consider that normal human emotion how do i identify marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help they are not giving the outward signs in the stupid lance corporal decker video we watch once a year thanks edit been at work all day then went to visit a former marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now mulled over a lot of this with him then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses i have read every one some several times i have a lot to consider and learn but thank you for helping me find some direction one thing i did not mention is my role in all this i am not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal i am a newly promoted sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me the one we just burried was not in my platoon but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss the other three were guys i was close to back in training but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened in fact i found out about all three of them on facebook this recent one and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me the scary thing to me is even with hindsight i would not have picked these five guys out of the lot as having any kind of issues let alone suicidal tendencies i have also noticed maybe because of my nature or leadership style that i am the one people tend come to with problems i make it known that i am here for that purpose and people take me up on it so i guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for i will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch thank you all for the detailed and informed replies
0,jesus great bloke great head of hair i am issuing a challange to everyone to guys lucky enough to be blessed with long locks to girls looking for something classic yet bold on their ball nights print out the following image of jesus christ and present it to your hairdresser ask them for the jesus if they are a decent stylist they will know what to do why is jesus hair so underrated check out that colour so brown and the volume my god do not even get me started on the parting on second thoughts i cannot be bothered posting the image you all know what jesus looks like and if you do not consult your bible
0,let the anonymity begin i think we all have something we want to talk about but that we cannot quite bring ourselves to reveal to anyone we actually have to see face to face i have an overwhelming feeling regardless of its veracity that no one will quite understand what i am saying but if you do please share any insights you have with me my views are not extreme or disturbing just a challenge for me let us start with the introductions i am a old single female this is not a solicitation for men to start asking me out it is simply a fact i love being single and being able to do whatever i desire with my life i have recently returned to grad school and changed my caree path extraordinarly i have also moved to a new city where i have made some great friends mostly male as is the norm for me i come from a christian household and still cling to my faith despite doubts and challenges the big challenge currently is sex for better or for worse i have a sex drive currently it is driving me mad but i also have a moral code that keeps me from even entertaining the idea of casual sex due to my odd combination of faith and life interests drinking smoking crude jokes liberal hippie crap independent lifestyle tolerance tattoos piercings etc it is very difficult to find anyone who is compatable with me and that is the beginning of the trouble when i do someone who looks good on paper i cannot get interested even though i desparately need to release some pentup sexual energy i am not looking for a solution per se but i am frustrated and venting what am i looking for hope so if you got it send it my way are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not appearing to be the christian norm i often consider giving in to a casual encounter but i honestly do not think i could physically go through with it and i would certainly beat myself up afterward not out of guilt necessarily but just cuz i know that is not what makes me happy life is good in so many ways and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who i am to myself and to anyone who cares to read them i am a very odd combination and i like it but i think most people find me very confusing probably think i am a prude and they like it from about feet away goodnight moon
0,invite me to celebrate been friends with this girl for over ten years we were our first best friends we ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college but we never drifted too far yesterday she turned she was coming into town to go to a local bar but not of age yet she told me i could come but i figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are i want to sit there drinking a sprite while they all got drunk so i let her enjoy her evening i figured she would celebrate later again anyway which she is today she posts on her snapchat story her and all our mutual friends underage friends drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments i was not invited i got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her pretty disappointed hurt and feeling lame as usual this has been a common theme for the past couple of years she hangs with a select group of about or people who known longer than her i really get invited to anything at all only once in a blue moon she sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college is it time to take a huge step back from this friendship i feel appreciated and i feel the effort is not there any advice
0,how to get over my ex best friend ok so all throughout high school i graduated high school years ago i had a best friend we were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever we graduated i got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt she told me one day she wishes i would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal being in my first relationship that currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because i was so excited anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought i was an awful friend because i was too busy for her fast forward a year after that we started talking again i reached out i always do we started being again but it felt so awkward honestly though the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same on her birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we talk much and she want awkward vibes at her house after that i just unfollowed her on social media and we talk at all i messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to china and then she messaged me on my birthday this all happened in so our friendship has been fucked up for like years now because i deleted her number a while ago i decided to reach out and talk to her on instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and i know she saw it so our friendship is dead known been dead too for like years now but how do i stop being so damn hurt i think it hurts even more because she truly give a fuck and she was my best friend ever i wish i could go back and do something else to fix it idk lately cried so much i been able to find a good friend like her again even though she that great how can i stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go i constantly look at her instagram to see how doing and it just really sucks

0,made grandma feel old xd setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy i am about to turn and this took place back in november of my family lives all along western washington and we do not see each other often so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral my cousins and i sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents only two of us kids are old enough to drink me and my year old cousin no one blinked an eye when he ordered an irish coffee but then the baby me ordered a rum and coke this resulted in two things my mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for southern comfort and coke and they said i drink poor people booze i am fresh out of college what do you expect my grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that i wanted alcohol what made this even funnier was when i got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting i am not anymore

0,urllink this is tc which stood for temporary cat too cute too cool and also stands for tender care that he receives due to his heart condition tc is years old and very sweet urllink
1,i want a cat so much due to depression and loneliness i once had a cat i had got for my birthday over years ago before she died at a bit of a young age just almost a year ago she helped me so much whenever i had suicidal thoughts when i would get them and tell myself how much i should die i would think of her and then ask myself who would take care of her she would be so devastated if her own master was gone i could never do that to her but ever since her death i think i have been more depressed and lonely without her i have been so much more angry and isolated i think i want a furry companion so so much but i do not think it will happen anytime soon no matter how urgent or how much i rather need one and that makes me even more depressed there is been so much going on so it is not a good time to look for a kitten however the thing is i do not know how much longer i have to wait and i do not know how much longer i can wait because my family moved and the house we live in is being renovated so i do not even have a room yet my wild guess is that it could take maybe a year for everything to settle but i cannot wait that long at all before getting a cat i am torn should i just get a cat for the sake of my health or should i endure the wait a little longer so things can settle down a bit more

1,awaiting the downward spiral had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together from all around australia for three days of drinking and festivities now i have travelled home and i am all alone again it is great that i have so many fantastic friends online but it is horrible we all live so far away i am already missing them terribly and feeling down i know that i am about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days it is inevitable but i am trying to prepare i am going to try and draw spend time with my service parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community to keep myself as positively distracted as i can i am already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex who i still love and miss so much and beating myself up searching for answers and ways how i could of been a better person for him he told me he hated me and that i made him feel like a child but i never intended for my help to make him feel like that i tried to support and encourage him with everything emotionally and financially i pushed myself to work a week when i was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless i tried to help him with being motivated to work and to be able to support himself i gave him every part of myself because i loved him so much and i keep holding on to things he said before he forgot what this love really meant to him and all the love that i gave to him that never got into him no matter how hard i tried i wish he knew i do not hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts were not to make him feel guilty i genuinely wanted to end my life the thoughts of whatever i had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me that i fear to live with a guilt that was my own i failed to be the person he wanted me to be but worse i failed to be the person i needed to be for him now we are apart and emotionally i am struggling to keep my head up financially i know he is struggling too everyone keeps teling me i should not care about him but that just makes me hate myself more that i do i know i am going to spiral further it is inevitable but i am trying to prepare breathes edits gramm

1,i am just one water molecule in a sea of depression nothing feels worthwhile to me anymore things i used to enjoy are depressing talking to someone about it is incredibly depressing at this point i do not even really see the point in this in just living in a loveless life in constant pain with nothing to look forward to but i am not special other people who are more capable moral and intelligent and crestive are depressed and are deserving of your love and affection they will probably make a recovery what are you waiting for
0,cousin cutting off family so my cousin has stopped talking to any of our family including his mother and brother i just assumed it was just life getting in the way but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car which i sold to him well under half of market value because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery he has stage liver cirrhosis my cousin never replied and money aside i can tell this really hurt my dad he is bottling it but i can tell considering this is my dads favorite nephew i feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult he just barely turned and i texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is our grandma died of the same condition and how he should not cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him but it has been already my main motivation for this is that i know stage cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and i want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be god forbid his last few years i just wanted to talk about this advice is very welcome and before anyone suggests he does not have the money he does he just sold the car we sold him for above market value and has a very good paying job as a mechanic at a car dealership
1,when i was i was raped by my boyfriend i was a virgin at the time and it was really hard to accept that this had happened to me i thought that somehow if i did not say anything to anyone or raise a fuss about it it was not true but it only made it worse when i tried to break up with him he tried to kill me we worked together and that made it really difficult to avoid him he told all his friends at work that i had given it up to him which was not true i was mocked and teased by the people that i felt had grown to be my family now five years later it is still something that hangs tightly in my mind and heart it is very hard for me to trust anyone and good relationships have been few i still look over my shoulder thinking he is going to be there again following me stalking me preying on me

1,this is a great topic it looks like people associate with what was shared i was laughing a little because for awhile i was so hypersensitive to sound i would not even consider turning anything on that created noise even the noise from lights was too much i used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room i could not stand it and used to turn it off then someone would turn it back on having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment that is funny to me now i still do not like noise but i am lucky since i have pretty good control over my environment for awhile i was working in cubicles and was not sure i was going to make it the one comment i wanted to share was what i experienced when i did turn the tv back on read the newspaper listened to the radio i went without it for two years what i experienced was the way the news was presented i was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories but the tone of voice the selection of what sound bites to use the background chosen for a shot i am still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night i had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something in my dream i was having a moral dilemma my integrity is important to me and in my dream i was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst i was in she kept saying give them what they want who are you to decide what is best for them i woke up before i decided to quit or stay but those words stayed with me through a day who am i to decide what is best for someone else what i do now is selectively listen to the news i like npr and sometimes enjoy mcneil lehrer i find if someone is expressing a strong opinion i will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint my main issue is selective presentation i feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them i want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion i want to know what level of uncertainty there is i do not like anyone telling me how to think or feel i am perfectly capable of creating all the drama i could ever use on my own i am not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there i know someone is to blame if only i could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect i am kidding about that last sentence i am just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my sharei am being frisky i support public broadcasting and free speech if i was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak would not it be great if there truly was free speech in america would not it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an american ideal is not it supposed to be

0,what is going on with my mom as i have gotten older i identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up but i am not really sure i am in the right for noticing this i have no idea what this is i have not met many other people that do this but my mom will do this thing where the happier i get the less comfortable she is around me she tries almost frantically or rabidly to cut me off mid sentence or like steal my affectation like mirroring that is a bit too eerily similar its almost like a being a person contest i always feel like gross afterward like someone got in my head and took a part of me then did a parody of it it seems like nothing is going in and only like warped versions of what i just said are coming out like her identity is being threatened or something and it is only when i am happy she seems completely comfortable when i am depressed and its still all out no in it is like she is doing a one man play i mean i could be overthinking this i just do not know is anyone skilled with like psychoanalysis or something it seems surreal i have rarely seen people do this am i doing something wrong like am i not being a person right or something she seems so unnerved by signs of happiness it almost makes me feel fake or something it legit feels like i am beating her at tennis or something like the more emotion i am feeling naturally she tries to one up me and hers does not feel natural it makes me uneasy is there a reason a person would do this i really am eager to know what this is or how i can avoid it or make ends with it

0,hello i am trying this blog thing for the first time i kind of like the idea of it today has started off pretty good i still have to vacum the house yesterday was a great day unfortunatly the voices in my head keep on telling me to do things things they have never told me to do before they used to always tell me to kill and to hurt but now they are trying to help me i think you see yesterday i went to the mall with my girlfriend and we went and saw a movie together my voices only come out in the dark and it happened to be just dark enough in the theater for me to hear them throught the whole movie they were telling me to do stuff like put my arm around her kiss her stuff like that sometimes it got plain disturbing the things they told me i will not repeat them but overall yesterday was an awesome day last night though when i got home they punished me for the times that i would not listen to them they were screaming inside my head that i am worthless that i have no chance of having a real life if i refuse to listen to them and last night i had a dream about what it would have been like had i listened to them i do not know what to do i think that they are trying to trick me to trusting them so that they can eventually have me do things that i will really regret but i do not know also my girlfriends ex richie grr must kill keeps on telling her that she has to break up with me and start talking to him again in order for her to have a chance of getting back into thespians god i truly do hate him he is using things that i cannot stand that i said against me now and it really gets to my girlfriend god i love her so frigin much but i just do not know what to do sometimes i think hell i know she still has feelings for him but i could not confront her about them in a million years my best friend kevin thinks that i should break up with her but god i just could not bear to do such a thing well i would better go i have got more to write i may post again later tonight

1,i am pretty sure that i will eventually kill myself at some point in my life unless something else kills me first it could be a month from now or years from now but i can almost guarantee that that is how i am going to die
1,i feel like a bit of a jerk posting here when i have not been around to support any of you so i hope someone out there is feeling generous tonight my background story consists on being depressed on and off for the past years or so i am now finally started antidepressants in october by december the side effects were not stopping and i stopped taking them because i always felt sick to my stomach and a person cannot work that way so i stopped them i have not been to the doctor since and have been feeling on top of the world even my coworkers have noticed a big difference and my manager has been giving me a lot of opportunity at work training new hires being on committees etc but then today hit like a ton of bricks to the head i am tired cranky i cannot stop crying and am trying very hard not to cut myself i hate everything and am just beside myself i do not know what to do i have the energy from when i felt great but i feel like crud and have no where to constructively place this energy i do not think i can go back to my doctor she will just tell me to take the drugs and stop whining i am not so sure i am depressed maybe i am normal and it is the rest of the world messed up that is a whole other story though can anyone here honestly say that medications work and you can be a functional person i mean will this ever end so i can get some peace any opinions or insight would be appreciated
0,what can i do in this situation after graduating high school last summer i stopped hanging out with all my friends some just stopped contacting me since they now live far away living in dorms and such and others i dropped because they were fake sometimes i do sort of regret it but that is only because of the loneliness and boredom i feel home alone on a weeknight i am currently taking a year off and i only have one close friend i have only known this friend for a year but we got along so well we had soo many things in common but now i feel like he is super fake for ex he talks crap about his friends but then posts photos and acts all nice and friendly around them when he talks about them with me it genuinely sounds like he hates them and says he never wants to hangout with them but then does not only that but nowadays whenever we hang all he seems to do is complain and judge other people like at first it use to be ok but now it is all the time it is so toxic and just a cheap form of communication imo he is also always late whenever we schedule a meetup not once was he ever on time sometimes he makes me wait an hour because he took his time to get ready when he knows that i am waiting for him we also never get to do what i want to do anymore because he is lazy for ex i really wanted to go to this cute cafe and he also did too but then on the day of he was taking so long to get ready we ended up not having time to go we only get to do what i want if he is benefitting from it just thinking about this makes me want to go to him right now and let out all my anger at his face i do confront him but it is almost as if he forgets i would tell him that i hate it when he makes fun of my body or rubs whatevers on his hands on my shirt as if it is a tissue but then a couple weeks later he will do it ugh just recently too he was telling me about his cousin and how she literally talks crap about everyone which led to me asking if she ever talked about me he said yes and she basically called me weird just because of my face shape i know it is nothing serious but it made me mad because i am super self conscious about it but what made me even more mad was the fact that my so called friend did not even stick up for me he did not tell her to stop or anything sorry that this turned into a rant but i really wanted some advice i feel so lonely when he hangout i feel as i have to be this super fun person because he seems to talk about how his other friends are so fun when he hangs out with me it was not always like this maybe we are growing apart from each other i do not know but i am purposely taking a break from him for two weeks we scheduled a meetup for his bday but idk how thatll go any advice or opinions are welcome i just want to hear what others think about my situation thanks
1,do you feel the same after seeing many of my classmates being successful in their lifes i felt terrible the trouble inside me just rooted even deeper i feel productive as i should be i feel like i just want to sleep forever not having to care about anything i texted so many people that says to text them when i need them but none of them replied maybe it is because of me who scared them away maybe it is because an introvert who hates interacting with people i just want someone who really cares about me who will cheer me up when sad right now just wondering why they have lifes that are so easy when compared to me i have problem both physically and emotionally i have been in the situation caused trauma and still haunt me every night jealous of them not having any emotional pains can someone just tell me something that will give me hope to live on we all probably need it thanks in advance
0,might have gotten my friend fired at work first of all hello just going to jump right in so i have been best friends with this girl call her maya for about years now another girl we will go with ashley became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time eventually maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time so we obviously really put a lot of hope into the whole thing but eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya now she started really getting into weed like blunts a day all by herself and then dropping pills on the weekends ashley and i are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a fell asleep b throw up all the time c was just super uncomfortable to be around also work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it so we were always late with her last week it really excalated she left ashley hanging for over an hour pick up her phone i cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests and all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss not even a reason why all of it happened obviously we were both really pissed and i just told our superior what had happened and why i was there instead of her needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go the issue is she kind of expected us to lie for her and i think i can deal with that anymore she has become so enstranged lately and i want to support her selfish and selfdestructive behaviour but now i guess i might have made her lose her job and i know if i should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that hate me forever and go on with my life told her that i like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off called me a coward and sheltered but she also treats me and ashley to an extend like her servants and all my other friends stand to be around her so really i know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life should i apologise o try to damage control the whole thing at work tldr friend has drug problem and left all of us hanging at work again so i play along with the hundredth shitty excuse she wanted us to tell
0,breast reconstruction implant position folks who have had breast reconstruction if you do not mind sharing isare your implants in front of or behind the pectoral muscle i am deciding between two different plastic surgeons one who prefers the more traditional method of going behind the muscle and one who uses what i guess is a newer technique of putting it in front i would love to hear about the healing process complications appearance and movementpain especially from very active people i am leaning towards the newer technique but since there is less documentation about it out there i am hoping to hear from people who have personal experience with it thank you

1,this is my first post so bare with me i have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband he told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father he told me that his mother never told him until he was years old and had to go to court to change his name i always wondered why he and his father never got along his mother will not tell him who his real father is i feel i need to help him find him so he can close the door and get answers to all his questions my husband does not like to talk about feelings he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you kept it to yourself i was raised totally opposite in ways this has left him hurt and confused he feels like he does not belong sometimes he told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less but it seems like it is always on his mind when family issues come about the man that raised him is an issue all to his own he is very abusive physically and mentally he is always telling my husband he is wrong and will never be able to be successful he has heard that all his life but he has never believed it he is strong and has a good heart it just hurts me when i see him lash out he takes all his problems out on me i now understand why i have not told him but i found out who his father is all i have is a name i want to tell him but do not know if i should i do not want his mother not to talk to him if he knows i am very confused i am right in the middle and do not want anyone to get hurt looking for advice or someone that can relate to this
0,languages are really an amazing thing they can differ so much or so little and they open up so much about the world and culture that speaks them languages are so much deeper than many people give them credit for but they are an essential part of the human experience if we did not have language we would not be human

1,the last few weeks i have slid back almost as far as before i started treatment just when i thought i was improving i finally went to the drop in center called sunshine place as someone was giving a talk on depression the counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought i needed more help than my gp was giving for the first time in a few months i actually broke down and cried again which is very annoying to me she wrote down the number of the mental health center with some suggestions for them i rang the next day for an appointment and that was hard just to ring she had told me i might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me but they made an appointment for the next day the psychiatirst there was okay i did not even cry like i normally do when talking to a new doc but i told her i was tired of telling the same things to every new person the short of it is they are changing me from lexapro to avanza and organizing for some cbt i see my regular gp next tuesday so i am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change i was also warned that i would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place so i duly warned mom and matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior matt as usual just laughed and said yeah moms going to go psycho now i just wait for them to contact me about the cbt if i do not answer any posts you will know why but i will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know i am thinking of you all and that i am still listening
1,how can i be happy if i have no friends i am in my first year of uni and everything has gone to shit i have friends but they never want to hang out with me i ask and they just ignore my texts or say they are busy i know everyone is really busy in uni but i take this so personally i feel like no one ever wants to be around me i try so hard to be nice to everyone and it seems like they only return the favor when it benefits them i try to be my own friend and spend time with myself but eventually it just makes me even more sad i do not understand why i do not have friends i have joined clubs and put myself out there and it just does not come together how do i not let this bother me how can i keep from being lonely when i am so so alone

1,i used to be you it gets better you have to love yourself first amp other lies not even sure if i should post in this sub but to the people who used to suffer from depression from trauma from anxiety from whatever made you miserable i am not you you were once miserable like me you saw no light at the end of the tunnel but then you did not give up something happened now you are happier now you have got your happy ending now you have got people who love you for who you are but i am not you you probably changed you probably were capable of change were strong enough to change yourself even i am not you i have been gone for a long time now there is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings sometimes i feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved but i think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost i cannot blame people for not loving me but i do blame them for lying to me do not they know it hurts more to say i care when they do not and it takes me much too long to figure it out how am i ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it is been such a common lie the worst part is nobody can prove it because nobody can help me because nobody knows how or wants to i do not know i have been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously you who says that i should not give up why i am not you years from now i will not be surrounded by people who love me i will not be anywhere closer to happiness i will not find anyone who loves me if that person exists and perhaps they do i will not ever have the luck to meet them you tell me i have to love myself before anyone else will those who grow in complete solitude do not even learn a human language so tell me if there is nobody to show me how to how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself i think you just want to place the blame on me i do not love myself and so that is why i am miserable not because of depression not because of isolation not because of poverty not because of heartbreak it is because i do not love myself in a world that is only taught me to hate and criticize myself in this world where the people i thought i could perhaps give my heart to say i care about you and then show me those words are meaningless forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when i have only seen my life decline since it began i am not even asking for pity because i know it is just the luck of the draw and i was dealt a particularly shitty hand but can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end just because you suffered for many years and i have suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to does not mean i am not going to continue suffering as i always have been

1,medicines can and do stop working i am going though this right now i suffer from chronic depression had it since i was and i am now so i have been suffering for years god i never realized how long it was i sat in therapy for years after my ex attempted to hang himself i saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother the first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault i knew then it was me who needed the help so for years i sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression if they did they never told me or put me on medicines when i switched therapists that was when she said that i needed medicines they gave me prozac that made a huge difference after the first weeks i took that for years then i had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that your body does not absorb the same so it stopped working i took effexor for a while did nothing and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all i am sitting here reading this forum and crying so basically medicines can stop working time to go get an adjustment
1,from the life i know all i can say is i know that after all we have been through and without preaching i know that you know that whatever your children choose in the path to lead you will support but and however i have many friends from all walks of life and we all share the same childhood in more ways than not and in any case not one of our childhoods has sculpted who we are today some of us on one side of the line some on the other my father while eating dinner with my brother and i for the first time in years last night while meeting new friends and people made a very correct statement while my little brother is the marine and i being whatever i might be am the emotional one this is true and yet my father has no clue about my emotional status issues what not just because one is emotional does not mean that his path is chosen i am going to stop being politically correct and you all know what i mean or at least i hope so i guess as i have lost my train of thought crazy in the brain all i can say is just make sure that the kids grow up and learn to take care of themselves never to rely on someone else to always make sure that they are taken care of in essence learn to wipe your own ass or you are going to be sorry because one day that ass wiper is going to be gone keep being the parent you are and you will all make it out ok that i can promise i am only years old and i have friends across the planet from all walks of life this i can tell you true

1,i posted here sometime in december i think i was having tons of digestive problems well it is been about months now and i am still having them but now i also feel extremely fatigued all the time too i have had test after test and seen doctor after doctor everything comes back negative i was actually put on zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other things bc that was not doing the trick either i am back to thinking that it is all in my head i am now on shots but those am not doing anything either i feel like a zombie i have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that i just want to put off all i want to do is sleep all day one thing i have noticed is that man do i ever waste time i mean i literally do nothing but waste time most of the day i only have about two hours of class per day and no job so i have tons of free time to waste away i analyzed what i did in the past hour and it basically went like this the entire time i was talking to myself nonstop analyzing things analyzing my situation thinking of motivational quotes etc i tend to do that all day for about minutes i stood around leaning against a wall the next minutes i leaned against the television then i went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head then i came on the computer to just look at random pointless things and that is pretty much how most of my time is spent i might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming that cannot possibly be healthy and i obviously have way too much free time i am just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness have i become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so i have an excuse to live like this
0,to expand a little on my previous thought i spend about of my free time alone i am engaged to my childrens father this is the time we are engaged he wanted to elope but i feel i deserve a wedding after all that i have been through we live in different places i with the children at my parents house and him with his mother and family his mother had a kidney transplant in december i understand that he wants to be there for her but my children and i suffer greatly he never comes around when he does she or his sister calls and he leaves sometimes i think she exaggerates her pain maybe i sound a little selfish or maybe exaggerate is not what i mean i think she tolerates her pain until she wants attention i feel bad for her because she suffers alot but at the same time i never get to see my fiance my kids never get to see their father there is a house down the street from her and the people want around monthly for a bedroom house he decided without me even seeing it that it was not good enough because the house is blue fiends drug addicts lived there and the kitchen is yellow he cannot see taking us from where we are now to move there he lives in a bedroom house with about people and a dog i live in a big bedroom house with my parents and i am cramped my son does not like to stay here because he thinks my parents do not like him my daughter has to stay upstairs with me because they yell about the house being dirty she does not like it there much either but he doesns see moving us from here because of a freakin yellow kitchen i have not been able to sleep or really eat since he told me this last night if anyone can give me a honest opinion on what is really good i would really appreciate it

1,i am and have been depressed for about a year i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain i cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i cannot stop i always reach for my knife when i am alone and hurting one of my major problems is that i am really good at hiding my feelings no one knows that i am depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself i told my best friend because we tell each other everything when i told her the only thing she could say was you are crazy not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight and even though i knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day i still supported her but now she is turning her back on me i think she thinks i am doing it for attention but i am not if i were i would not hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts any way so now i have no one there to talk to i do not trust anyone anymore and i am too scared to tell my parents even if i did they cannot do anything i have other brothers and my parents do not have the time or money to deal with my problems i really scare myself i have already planned out how i am going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but i still try i just really need some one to talk to someone who will understand where i am coming from
1,no doubt in my mind that since i have been taking zoloft i do dream a lot more and sometimes very vividly most of mine do not make any sense either but on occasion my remembered dreams are so real it is almost spooky if only those dreams were somewhat romantic well then i would not be bringing this up would i lol another thing i noticed is that if i am asleep and my cell phone rings i get up walk a few feet away answer carry a short conversation and afterwards i have no recollection whatsoever it reminds me of sleep walking that is so unusual and strange to me you are not alone xxx and i am so glad you are feeling much better
0,urllink come now is the time to worship brian doerksen vineyard music discography when i read the words part of me still says how corny and then i blush because this particular song on the cd i was given has gotten me through the past few days when i hear it it is like a call to the mountainside at sunrise i feel a heartbeat and it makes me feel a little more alive it has intensified my prayer and surely that cannot be a bad thing
1,i started volunteering with the red cross to help with my anxiety and depression they fired me from volunteering for not having good enough attendance i am really trying to help myself through volunteering and it really hurts that i cannot even do that
1,i will never be able to take care of myself let alone anyone else i physically cannot find the energy to even do the most basic things like laundry showering and eating grocery shopping is a really tiring adventure that is followed by a four hour nap my schoolwork to rest ratio is i cannot even remember to water the singular plant that i own they always end up dying before i even realize i do not even know how i would be able to take care of a pet let alone any kids it is a really good thing i do not want kids because i would be a terrible neglectful mother i would hardly have any energy to make them food let alone entertain them i do not understand how people can clean and do laundry and brush their teeth every day they are mountains to me
1,nice to see you too how are you today i think you really have hit the mark on what i was trying to express with this question all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name the disasters you mention such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings as for those forensic shows ugh i used to be able to watch them but way before this recent episode of mine i stopped i could not stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there where i work now one of the first friends i made was a gentleman who has since retired he told me that he did not read the news watch tv or listen to the radio except for light jazz because he found that to do so was just too much pain it did not serve him to subject himself to that kind of pain he seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it as for your friend that is a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her tv choices are on you does she ever read or post here anyway it is great talking with you again and i look forward to the next chat i hope you have a wonderful day and weekend
1,does anyone else feel insanely angry when they see injustice against others like i feel like i seethe with rage when i see others being mistreated every time i watch the news about the political storm in america or anything i see in my twitter about police brutality or slavery in libya etc i seethe with rage i cannot stand seeing so many people being tortured financially mentally physically i hate it i feel powerless and i feel angry i feel like my depression grows with other peoples pain the more i see injustice the more powerless and worthless i feel in the world
0,yup today was just one of those days everyone has them they are inevitable along with many other things in life i woke up late and is not it funny it seems that most days when you start them off bad by sleeping in when you should not they just go downhill from there it is true observe your day next time you wake up late but it was not the small annoyances that made my day one of those days these small things such as being late for work the kids being off tripping over everything breaking my cell phone on one of the trips and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life much bigger today as i look on my life right now it seems like utter chaos and i do not like it i am trying to be strong but lately i just do not know how do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you know it is especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else between this and many other things going on i for the first time in my life feel completely lost and i spend a lot of time trying not to feel sorry for myself sometimes it works sometimes it does not i do not know how people can deal with so much worse and it happens daily and in tragic ways so this pattern of thinking does put things in perspective bc my life is not exactly tragic but my sentimental side tends to still succeed in getting in the way anyway let us just say that after today i hope i wake up one time tomorrow so it is not another one of those days
0,well i think i know what my problem is i am not opinionated enough to own a blog i am totally indifferent about almost everything so i can never think of anything to write maybe i will just write about what i did last night ben and i went to the park with his aunt uncle and cousins to watch a tongan brass band play we ate chicken from sugarhouse barbecue and it was so yummy i do not know what their secret is but their chicken tastes just like camping then the plan was to go back to the cousins house to have brownies and ice cream and play halo so i asked to be dropped off at home because i did not want to stay up all night plus i do not enjoy video games very often well they opted out of playing halo because they wanted me to come have ice cream with them so i went even though i hate it when people change their plans for me it makes me feel whimpy so anyway you might think that means we got home at a reasonable hour but we still ended up staying there until midnight i do not know how those guys bens cousinsauntuncle can stay up so late all of the time and still get up at to go to work it is hard for me for some reason as soon as i graduated from college i turned into an old fart who has to go to bed on time totally lame well it looks like i have a little bit of an opinion after all at least about people changing their plans for me and going to bed on time who knew
1,the beautiful things in life light streaming through the leaves of a tree the night sky thousands of pinpricks in black velvet someone so beautiful they make you catch your breath when you look at them those songs that make the hairs stand on your arms the only thing that keeps me alive is the beauty in the world it makes time slow down just for a little and stops the incessant flow of mostly negative thoughts there is so much beauty left to see it can be as amazing as the the clear blue waters surrounding a tropical island it could be as mundane as a flock of birds flying in harmony over your roof sure there are a lot of really shitty things that we go through but there are those breathtaking moments you have yet to experience those moments where you think damn it really is nice to be alive
0,i am beginning to think i am the third wheel so i am currently feeling a bit left out as my two best friends seem to be getting along together much more than they used to and they are beginning to push me away is there anyone i could pm for some help thanks
0,okay so maybe i am not employee of the month but when it is time to work i work hard it is quite annoying when a particular person sees that there is stuff to be done but chooses to stare off into lalaland instead they should thank their lucky stars i am not their superior because they would be canned on the spot if it were up to me you know what is weird when you see little kids you used to babysit back in the day all married with kids no one wants to enjoy the single life anymore huh god dammit that just means i am freaking old maybe i am past the finish line skurrry
1,does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things it seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life and i am suffering with depression which of course makes me feel worse and then i feel guilty for not being happy for them but i also get angry when they flaunt their happiness around me my roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony we both signed up at the same time for fun and while i was rejected time and time again she was so picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with i am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it but i get so angry that she is constantly doing things with him it is like i have been replaced i feel like a year old for thinking that but i just cannot help how i feel today for example i asked her if she wanted to watch a movie i had gotten off our digital cable we have it until tonight and she said she would like to i was pretty excited seeing as how i had not been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of zach going well she just came down stairs and said that zach is going to be coming over now this ticks me off because she broke our plans and i do not have a way to escape when they are here i am sure she is going to want to watch that movie with zach and i know i am being selfish but i do not want him here tonight i have not gotten to see angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work he is going to be here so i have to put on my happy face and pretend that i am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all i will feel like doing is crying it is unfair why does it seem like when you are depressed everyone around you has these great things happening in their life angela just got a promotion a new car and now a new boyfriend i am stuck in the same job same crushing car payment and i have not dated anyone in over years

1,depression and grief i am a yr old m who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant mdd from the age of recently i was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a nyc hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background one item which came up that i have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when i was around my uncle was a yr old gay m developed hiv and killed himself though this is not what i was initially told it took around years with every year or so getting a new piece of information initially i was told he had cancer and died then i was told he had cancer and my grandparents pulled the plug then i was told he was gay had cancer and my grandparents pulled the plug then i was told he was gay had hiv and my grandparents pulled the plug then finally i was told he was gay had hiv and killed himself i think i secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when i was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on even if i did not i always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful after discussing his death for two hours for the study i realized that the depression i have been feeling for over years is so similar to the feeling i get when i think of my uncle intense grief i delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long i know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time i would love to hear some thoughts and opinions i do not know exactly what i am looking for by posting this but i have really been struggling with the emotions i have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not some affirmation

1,heres my answer to your age question sadly i am years old do not get me wrong i do not want to be completely alone for the rest of my life there is a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy but i have such a tall hurdle to overcome before i can even get to that yet yeah but i can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself it really is such a luxury nowadays personally speaking one thing i reflected on was that i live in a family of people and maybe that is why i feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people essentially there is no secure privacy really yup like you i used to live independently when i went to school i am on a bit of a break right now but will go back in september where i will share an apartment with a roommate i do not know right now i am mooching off my parents food and shelter at age i feel like a little child and by the way i am unemployed too i tried all summer to land a job but in vain i only worked one day for elections canada and that was it oh well a paycheck is a paycheck right the thing is i cannot stand living with somebody i hardly know either sometimes i just do not want to greet somebody at breakfast or say a polite hello how are you or how was your day when i battle depression and social anxiety i really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times the last thing i need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters but it is something i cannot help i will probably isolate myself in my room for a while at least i get cable tv and the internet then again i will probably become a complete hermit during the school year

1,i am a year old female that has had depression since i could remember i started cutting myself in high school and stopped when i graduated with very few relapses but for the past year i have been wanting to i just recently had a son who is my pride and joy but my son is the only thing that i have in my life his father is not around and everything in my life just seems to be getting worse i constantly stare at the razor in my hand and just want to release all this pain and sorrow and loneliness that i feel but i cannot bring the razor down because i can only think what my one year old son would think if he knew what i wanted to do i just need to know another way to release the pain because i can not figure anything out i know how cutting makes me feel released but i know that i cannot do it anymore help me
1,i do not think who try to kill themselves actually want to die from my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident i think people do not really want to die we just want the pain to go away all the shit we take and all the heavy baggage we have to carry just makes us tired and lose hope when we ponder on death we see an easy way out so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer moreover i watched a video of suicide survivors about those who survived suicide claimed that in their final moments when they were throwing themselves from a high place they said they would regret everything and wanted to live now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments personally i have been close to do it but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that i noticed that it is not worth it i still have things i want to do sure getting out of bed is still a huge task today it took me hours just to do it but i did it i am not sure if i should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both depression sucks that is a fact we all know but suicide is not the way to go there is always another way at least that is what i like to think

0,i feel like the friendship i have is fake on her behalf i have known this girl for going on years i am not the type of person that has many friends or is very sociable i try to keep to myself and mind my own business and care to hag out with people we met at work and i liked that there was so much that we had in common almost like i could see myself in her we became friends however there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship we are both waitresses and she would ask me how my night was and how much i made it made me feel a bit uncomfortable because the way she asked seemed a bit odd if i would make more than her she would seem a little upset if she made more she seemed to be happy even now when i make more than her she says hate she says her and gets mad if i hang out with someone else without her knowing tagget tagged by other people on fb or go places without inviting her although she does all of these things as well but i get upset or mention them when we started working at a different restaurant right off the bat there were people that like me these are people that are problematic and always because drama which i cannot tolerate well my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back hated me and made up rumors about me decided to invite on them to her house at that moment i realized that this fakeness was not just in my mind my friend likes a lot of attention she gets upset when she get it or when i do my friend likes to judge other taller thin my friend sees every imperfection in others my friend expects me to invite her out buy her treats bring her things to work but she has never offered to do the same for me although she does it for others my friend posted emojis on my fb wall on my birthday face blowing a kiss party popper birthday cake two women holding hands woman dancing i always congratulate her and wish her well my friend calls me her how real is this friendship for her i forgot to mention that i always try to give her christmasbirthday presents according to what she likesmostly earrings or pretty blousesdresses she rarely gives me gifts which is fine i expect anything in return but when she does something that has nothing to do with me like a size large red and blue supermanlogo hoodie a size small or a random item she finds in the clearance section

0,where did i go wrong let me apologize by the rather lengthy post not sure where to start recently been having trouble with my friends and not sure why i had a childhood friend since elementary school we would hang out often and now a stranger she would say she was busy but the last day i texted her my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney they removed the whole kidney and the day he got home i texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay she even take one second to respond glad your dad is that was it for me i had to remove her on facebook after she had to replied after a week two weeks etc and i believe i deleted all messages on my cell phone and not sure what happened then this of mine never messages me on either instagram or facebook i think it began when i told her i asked out one of her friends a year ago we are still friends the girl i asked out and from then she started not to respond to me so recently i told my friend who i asked out about the communication between me and her friend she told me that her friend who is also her roommate that both extremely busy which i understand but and that loves me and hate me my friend who respond and not love in a boyfriend way but if this is the case why she communicate with me online even when i see her she waved hi to me and we talk a bit but not the same there were times in the past where she use to hug me a lot any time she saw me but something has changed with her and me i can tell i think my friend the girl i asked out is unaware of my her roommates true feelings toward me and i mean that in a bad way just not sure where i went wrong

1,ok so i have had depression for at least years and it has gotten a lot worse the past two my mom tried shoving prozac down my throat and swore that it helped me but it did not i did not talk to a counselor until about a month a go i was going to school and every time i went to main campus i would get ds and fs i would start out ok but then end up sleeping more and more this past quarter i physically could not get out of bed at one point my parents just saw it as me blowing my last chance at college and took it as i did not care it seems like i do not feel anymore i do care that i blew my last chance at college and i finally decided to see a counselor weeks before the end of the quarter my parents said the only reason i did that is because i knew i was in trouble and just needed an excuse i do not know why i do not do the things i know i should be doing i just feel like i cannot my parents say it is all my fault that i do not take responsibility for anything and i just want to blame everything on something else which is not the case they do not think that depression has anything to do with not trying that it does not affect rational decision making i am starting to think it does not either i mean why cannot i do the things i know i am suppose to do the things that will better my life the things that will make my parents proud is it the depression or am i truly lazy and just do not care because everything my parents are saying is making me think it really is just me and i do not have depression

1,i do not want to get out of depression i have had it for so long i just cannot get out amymore i feel like i do not deserve to get out because of all the stupid stuff i have made i am starting to not take my pills and trying to socialize less i will only get out of depression when i know i deserve it when my life has no problems and then i will know that there has no problems on my life
1,first instinct when i wake up is to immediately try to go back to sleep to avoid the crushing anxiety and depression anyone else immediately try to go back to sleep as they are conscious i am like no not this fucking shit agin sleep is the only relief i get but that is obviously not sustainable i really do not know what to do anymore do not even know how i am alive at this point
0,well friends it was not pretty but after hrs of sleep i dragged my sorry butt out of bed to take on the mean streets of venice ca i joined my friends samaya and bianca to start training for the marathon we are part of a group called the l a roadrunners original i know do to a knee injury i just walked today regardless i am very excited about everything going on over the next months leading up to the race after training we went on over to robecks in the nut to toast our first day with shots of wheatgrass we even have our picture plastered on their wall it is not even noon yet and i have already had quite an eventful day look for another post later today until then it is nap time
1,anyone else feel bad for their parents for having to deal with a depressed kid been feeling so bad for my parents lately they try so hard to help me and spend so much time and money on getting me medicine and therapy but still i always let them down and show now sign of improvement such a disappointment both to me and those around me i hope you guys can relate
1,so here is my situation i want to go to university problems i do not have a cent to my name parents will not give their ok on the issue and i have not had a job in over a year and there are no prospects in the near future i could go behind their backs and apply for a loan but i would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all i do not want money from them some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good if anything it will make me feel worse about myself i have not accomplished a single thing in my life and feel this is pretty much the last straw to do something meaningful but day after day there is another block and i have no means of getting around it i am dependant on my parents who are usually the blocks and i hate it this is not something i want its something i need
1,afraid to post my own commentsopinions on social media i am just realizing that all of the social medias i have or use ig twitter tumblr reddit and so on i only repostlike other users posts and rarely post my own idk seems like i am afraid of what others think of me and that i am insecure about something
1,i think i have insomnia and depression i do not sleep at night i stay up and think i toss and turn my mind races and my life has gone nowhere i am in college and lately i just have not been able to function at first i thought it was laziness but it is much more than that i do not even feel like doing the things i used to i do not feel like hanging out with my friends i am normally kind of introverted but it has definitely gotten worse lately i have just wanted to be alone all i have been doing is sleeping during the day just laying around zoning out i really have not felt like doing anything at all all i want is to crawl into a hole and sleep forever i have so much to do schoolwork wise and i just cannot too it i am physically emotionally and mentally weak i do not know what to do i was told to talk to our school counselor but it is really hard for me to open up to new people especially those i do not know i do not think i could explain my problems to him i do not know what to do i cannot just snap back into life i always end up here empty and depressed why what should i do
0,hello all this is my blog instead of use it as just a playbyplay of my how my day went i will probably use it as a place to dump my opinions this is my little corner of the internet so to speak and i will use it to show the world my superiority because no matter what you say i am better than all of you cough anyway so yeah i hope you all enjoy reading this if you do not oh well it is obviously all your fault well i will cya next post
1,my friends are throwing a lan party and i was not invited i was the only one who did not get an invitation
1,are my struggles even legitimate rant i have been wondering that for a long wile after a friend told me that there life had been worse so i had no right to be the way i am and yes i have had a better life then a lot but dose that lessen my experience and hardships yes i have a supportive family and yes i have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind so i have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit yes i know nobody liked school but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over did all kids struggle with basics in school did every kid end up feeling alone no mather what he or she did there entire life did they have to feel so alone and unconnected i know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me i know wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me you think i know that you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence am i really that defective that i am just not good enough just because things are moving forward and good for now make my feelings and inner turmoil go away do you think i wantedwant to be this sad excuse of a human being i say anything to anyone i have learnt that i not only feel alone but i am alone people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway so i guess have to go back to bottling everything inside again maybe when the glass brakes and i cave i will be free maybe i will find my freedom in death idk anymore i just know sorry for the long rant and thanks for reading if you did
1,i think about multiple ways of killing myself everyday but i cannot bring myself to do it i am so done feeling so so alone i have friends who i can talk to but i feel like i am burdening them everytime i am pretty much done with my life my studies are going nowhere and i have no motivation in life i thought of running into the road but i would not want to be that selfish and traumatise some innocent driver i thought of throwing myself off the building but i would not want my family to be burdened with that gruesome image
1,tired of being lonely but not much i can do about it i just want to feel like someone to talk to out there but no one in my life ever wants to talk with me about anything except to yell at me or to tell me to do something that is the extent of my daily social life i could probably go a month without saying anything or talking to anyone and no one would even care or notice i need social interaction like anyone else but what do i do if i get it i can interact at work ok but not really the same online interaction really the same either
1,every day is exactly the same i am lonely worthless and done with life every day i wake up go to work come home and go to sleep that is basically it that is my life sure i have a few friends that i see on the weekends but it only helps so much my ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment months ago now the almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent when she came home that day and told me she was done i was floored i had no idea that she felt the way she did and she would not even discuss the matter with me i have tried meeting other people since then and i have gone on exactly three dates with one person that is it i am basically invisible to women and no amount of effort will ever change that i just have to accept the reality that i hold absolutely no value in a romantic context why i do not know maybe it is because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier or make the most money maybe it is because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off both men and women are at fault for this i do not think i am a particularly unattractive guy and i make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age but since i am not in that top of men i am just always going to be passed over and there is absolutely nothing i can do about it it is almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy no matter how much money i make or how much i improve myself that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back i did not ask for this but it is the way things are so i have pretty much given up completely i do not have any plans of offing myself or anything like that but every day it gets harder and harder to convince myself that i actually have anything worth living for the one thought i keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if i gave her to a shelter or how she would get by if i were gone i love my cat and she does not deserve to be put in a situation like that i feel like she is the only thing keeping me marginally together the thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she is happy and feels safe i feel worthless and frustrated i wish i understood how to achieve what i want in life and be happy but i guess that is just not in the cards i cannot wait until the day i die i will finally get some goddamn peace and quiet i am so tired of feeling broken i am so tired of constantly being reminded that there is something wrong with me like i am some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be i have struggled with this for years now i do not know how much more i can take
1,sometimes i hate myself and its really hard to fight some times i can ignore it but other days i really am struggling

0,abusive dad or i am just toxic two weeks ago my dad lost our dog it went to the shelter but due to the microchip ownership issue we have to wait two weeks to get her i told my family that there is a chance that we might not get the dog back my dad then started saying how it is fate that the dog is gone and that if we cannot get it back then it is destiny i got annoyed and said but really it is because you were not being careful and you left her at the park he then started yelling at me saying he is the only one who walks the dog i then said i walk the dogs as well i just do not do it enough because i am the only one in the family who works from morning to night paying for the bills groceries and everything he then claimed that it is not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it would it be his fault i responded with yes it is your fault because it is under your duty of care anyway things got ugly from there i did not speak to him for a week he got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines i paid for the one today this morning then he asked to borrow my car and i lent it to him after that he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog e g bailey you are lucky that i am here if i was not here you would have died a long time ago some people just know how to talk and do not do shit i got annoyed and said you lost the dog get over it he then yelled at me i got annoyed and told him to fuck off he then started saying wow you are being so disrespectful god will punish you i wish you die and i wish you will live out your life alone i then said you came home and started a fight for no reason do not play the victim when i argue back he then said i am just talking to myself you do not have to listen to me i then said go talk to the wall then i shut the door and continue with my business he then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how i will die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me i then angrily snapped at him saying i may or may not die before you but i can bet that if you die no one in this fucking world would mourn for you i then shut the door and i did not hear anything from him again not sure if i have a abusive father or i am just toxic or maybe it is both i do not want to live like this anymore
0,i told my friend not to go to a football game and i still went i am a guy who does not like having to wait for others i get things done faster on my own he was coming an hour away and he is visiting from out of state so he does not know the area apparently he was going to borrow a friends car but was not sure all before the game started in a few hours i was like screw it i am not dealing with this i basically convinced him not to go saying it was too expensive and that you will get lost i was being honest and he agreed i was not going to wait for him not knowing when he would arrive i still went and i do not care sometimes you just have to be selfish and look out for yourself others can hold you back
1,i am new here but i would like to know how to tell if i am in depression i have no idea where to post this at but since i am new here i guess this is the best place plus i cannot start a new topic so well anyway heres how it is some days i can go without thinking about her but at night when i rest my head on my pillow she eventually runs across my mind when i say she i mean my ex more like i am her ex but eh this took place a while back maybe like a year and a half i met her years ago in highschool she was my very first true girlfriend and i did not want anything to mess that up but somehow i did that myself or something along those lines after a while of missing someone it does not really matter who was the blame for what sometimes when i make music i sing lyrics about her and how i want another chance and whatever i am not really obsessed with her or anything but i sometimes want to just forget about her all at once or wish i could go back years i guess that might be linked to regrets anyway this whole thing is sort of an onoff type thing where sometimes i cannot help but think about how it was and sometimes she is that last thing on my mind sort of like i put her on the back of my mind not to think about her and save my hurt of later if that sounds right maybe i need a shrink who knows maybe i just need another girl but i am pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships anyway feedback is appreciated

0,i do not know if its me but it seems like whenever i do not see alex i really do not care i start to think that there has no reason to actualy like him i start to think that there has others like adrian or conor or someone else but when i do see him its completely different i feel like there has noone else but of course i am just being stupid and tired
1,you know how everyone hates those family get togethers at least i do all my family is out of state and i rarely get the chance to ever see mine but that is off point i have severe depression and a terrible panic disorder at my last doctor appointment we were discussing easter coming up and how hard it is for me to go to my in laws especially since no one there will ever talk to me that is a whole other subject anyway it was suggested to me that maybe we could invite the family over here for easter so that i would feel more secure that way i could be busy with food and not feeling bad because no one will speak to me my husband at the time when i spoke to him about it said that maybe it was a good idea would be good for me well today we had a bit of an argument over something i tried to do in here today i just wanted him to try and understand what its like for me since he considers this a weakness not an illness anyway of course he went to his mothers and accepted her offer for dinner and then came home and announced it to me he did not even bring up the possibility of maybe having it at our house not even for me also they have no idea about my illness he is embarrassed i think anyway now i feel like he will never try to take my feelings into consideration i fell like throwing up i feel like shit i feel unloved

0,is he justified for being so mad thoughts on my plan no judgment please months ago i stayed with my aunt for two weeks but i really wanted to see my cousin who been talking to on facebook well i get to see him until like the day before i was supposed to leave and get to speak with him as the way we were seated at our gathering have to literally yell across the table and not like that so later that night i got in an uber and went to his house around like pm lmfao and i told him i was coming but he was like no and he was pissed that i say much to him but i showed up it was raining freezing windy etc and he let me in and so i left and went back to the airport cuz i have enough money to go all the way back to my aunts it was like something miles away i only had enough to get to newark but he got super pissed at me and talk to me blocked me on all social media but your girl is about to take that train for hours and go again in like julyaugust but not telling him just going to wait till he gets off of work i have zero way of contacting him other than physically going there any idea what i should say so he can forgive me aware what doing could potentially make things worse but if i leave it be we might not ever speak again also lost a substantial amount of weight since then and he probably recognize me thoughts please i know what some of you might say but i really want to fix this
1,if i killed myself no one would care or know
0,my best friend feels more like my daughter i love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her you can know i would be there in an instant but i feel awful admitting that i really do not like spending time with her anymore we are both in our late twenties and i am sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents a choice i completely agree was for the best we have been best friends for the past decade and i have seen her through some really difficult times she is faced a lot of struggles mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life unfortunately many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship we spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out i have gotten up at to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she is scared i have left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears days that are supposed to be fun a movie a game night making dinner together end up with me supporting her because she is upset about something and suddenly the whole evening is gone i do not want to exaggerate but i would say of the times i see her i have to go into support mode and unfortunately i have realized that i do not enjoy her as a friend and i honestly do not think i ever will again the dynamic of our friendship has changed and it is never going to be what it was do not get me wrong i care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me but the fact of that matter is i have found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it is just not a pleasant experience when we do hang out it is not because i want to it is because i feel that is what she needs she is a burden she is a burden i bear willingly but she is a burden i do not know what to do i really wish there were an easy way to say i do not like you anymore so please do not be hurt that i do not reach out but god you do not know how much i care about you
1,being an adult fucking blows working a shit job that keeps me poor making me want to just jump in front of a bus seriously struggling to see why i would want to engage in living when it is so menial and relatively pointless cannot see any friends as i live so far away and my family simply do not know how to support me working at a shit paying job with zero prospects and massive student debt how can i possibly look forward to anything in the future when the present is always painful mental illness is just poisoning every aspect of my world and i cannot be fucked to fight it i just wish i could live more on my own terms but apparently that is selfish and naive
0,went through tough times friends were not there but i still want them in my life i have best friends from high school since we were young long story short we were the best of friends had a great friendship and were really good to each other we are all now and i went through a bad time the end of last year my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work and had alot of issues with my childhood come up the only difference with my friends and i is that i grew up in a completely different way then they did i was raised in foster care that was tough i grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home they do not seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why i am the way i am sometimes i need my space and need to be by myself being in a foster care that had terrible people in it i never had celebrated birthdays since a young age like and when i was was when i found out that they are special days and so when birthdays do happen i may come across as blunt or do not make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes and they take all of that as i am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and do not make plans with me same as when my brother was shot i was a mess initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off but as always we came back together and were just like old times i know and they know i am a person who likes to deal with things on my own but i just feel like a burden in their perfect world i feel like their parents do not like me because of my family history and the way i grew up i just do not want to always feel like a burden on my friends

0,telling my bestfriend she is long winded without hurting her feelings my bestfriends and i have been bestfriends for about years we met in our college choir and are still in college just for context when were at school we basically hang out every night and i love her but when she gets started its like she does not know when to stop i have had to resort to redirecting my attention when she is been going on too long she tells me the same or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking even when i bring to her attention she mentioned something before it usually never stops her from telling me again it does get kind of awkward when i have to ignore her but it has not stopped her from rambling i just do not want to hurt her feelings because i know she talks to me because i am one of the few people she feels this open to drain everything into any advice
1,girl so in the past months i been talking to this one girl i love everything about her and we really clicked together seeing as we are both socially retarded literally everythings been looking up i started working out being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments i am not exactly depressed just do not really feel much emotion and i do not relate to people around me never been a fan of going out and i have had major problems getting to know anyone i only have very close friend besides her i have always had the feeling that i am tolerated but not wanted whenever i am around others but this chick changed that completely i actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni on a side note we also like pretty much the same things similiar music taste similiar views similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games books and other shit i knew i was steadily falling in love with her something i honestly thought impossible before and just recently i found out she is got a boyfriend i proceeded to spend the next hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade after that i could not even hit any fucking awp shots in cs because i still had tears streaming from my eyes my question is have i reached the point of being pathetic enough that i should call it quits and neck myself
1,i would like to say hello to everyone i have bipolar and was doing a bit of research into my illness which i have not done before as i have always denied having the illness i do have funny story to tell a few years ago now i lost the plot and lost my home wife and children as a result not that funny but at the time i did not know i had bipolar new life spending loads of money racing up the career ladder on a high i meet this fantastic girl we went on holidays together had some great times after a year or two i moved in with this girl gave up my good job and planned a future for us both marriage extra there was one thing holding us back we both hard bipolar and never told each other about or illness as we thought this could change everything as you can imagine if she when on a high i went on a low and when i went on a high starting companies and buying things i could not afford she would go on a low our relationship did not last for much longer as she would self harm and i would attempt suicide it was not until i went into hospital that it all came out in the open we are still friends but both agree that two bipolar people do not match my doctor did smile and we did laugh about it anyway i am new and just want to say hi to everyone
1,hi i am and new here i have suffered from acute depression for getting on for months now i currently take citalopram having tried fluoxetine but it was not doing much good for me i selfharmed onandoff from the age of to and have been stopped since last june i recently became engaged on boxing day and last month emigrated to live with my fiance i have previously received some cbt for depression and ocd but that stopped when i went to university in sept my mental health deteriorated drastically whilst at university and in december i made the decision to leave i am hoping that i will soon be able to get some counseling or other sort of psychological therapy here and to start coming off my medication at some point soon although i do not want to rush that as i do not want a relapse
0,i am scared hey guys posting this on a throw away just incase anyway a bit of back story me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits we both happen to smoke weed so naturally we started hanging out together it was all cool for a while and then he started getting needy trying to get whatever he could from me he would ask for cash ask me to buy him food ask me for bud etc then i found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker which is something i do not agree with at all he just became more hostile around me after this point not physically only slightly verballyemotionally so i decided to slowly break the tie so i started to ignore his messages and facebook texts i quit work btw its been months he does not know where i live but we both know that our town is very small basically everyone knows everyone here so the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible anyway as bad as all that sounds i want to try and mend the relationship what should i do i have added an image for reference edit i never blocked him i deleted my account because fuck facebook
0,one of my biggest downfall is that i am too emotional i realized this today right now before i logged on my being emotional is causing a big problem you do not realize how much you love someone until they are gone ever heard of it yeah it is the famous cliche that you never think you can relate to until it happens no it has not happen to me but i feel that i am getting close and it hurts i do not want to give up but what if he has what if he is just over it you know that could be it i am all messed up i should have stuck to the idea that he is too good for me i told him from the beginning that i am no good for him but he would not listen he just wanted what he could not have and now he has it he does not want it why i am mean why do people function like this i have to admit i do not exclude myself from this terrible disease but why why do people always want what they cannot have because it is challenging that is it i need some alone time some time to think things through when i told him yesterday that the longer we are together the more scared i get i did mean the more scared i get to lose him but as i was thinking today i think i am scared i do not know of what because i have been wanting this for so long now after i got baptized this just became more real than ever this is it antoinette this is all for real no joke so what is so scary about that i guess this is what they call cold feet this is the time that the questions start rolling in do i really want to tie down so soon can i help make it work forever will the love last forever do i really love him does he really love me is this really love are these even questions you bring up in a deep deep conversation am i being too emotional i need some alone time some time to think things through because this is for real no joke i want to do the right thing because deep down inside my little heart it sure feels like the right thing
0,redpilling my son little background i have two sons both eurasians one is just about to turn and one has just started high school he is into stuff i would consider for lack of a better word beta his interests include puppets and lego i have tried to takes these things off him and force him to enjoy some more grown up things but my wife keeps giving them back so i know he is going to struggle with women in highschool because he is super beta and will definitely put them off with his interests and his racial condition so i am asking if their are any fathers who have redpilled their children about women and what the best process of introducing redpill philosophy and sexual strategies to my beta son i am thinking he is the right age as now he is beginning to notice girls i bought him some nudie mags and i know he is been checking them out if you know what i mean so i definitely think the time is right to give him the redpill thanks magnus

1,do you ever secretly hope you get cancer do you ever go to sleep and console yourself with pretty thoughts as you close your eyes do you ever desperately pray every night to wake up with brain cancer so you can go peacefully ffs my wrists are patched today but deep down i know if i really was brave enough i would have gone completely now i have to face people wearing the fucking bandages and they will all pretend they did not notice and it will be fucking awkward and the worst part is i am still here if it was cancer they would cry a bit and buy me a drink and say how tragic when i finally go my heart breaks for all the precious souls trapped in bodies struck by that horrible desease while my own body stubbornly keeps existing and breathing and providing home for this rotten mind and filthy soul and i feel i have ripped off everyone that could use this body and it is so disgustingly unfair i really really want to go but i am a coward and i am trapped

0,i am unsure of our friend status it is making head go crazy and heart go ballistic a few months earlier this year a friend of mine and i had dinner we started talking about our personal lives i have discovered things he went through and it hurt my heart to find out what he went through he was able to open up to me and i felt privilegged to be that friend whom he is shared this with he is closer to two other guys other than me but he is told me he has not told anyone else his dark side other than me i hope to open up to him one day ever since then i felt like i want protect him and see him find his happiness reach his goals and find the girl of his dreams my head has going around in cirlces and i feel like i need to have a proper conversation with him to confirm what this friendship means to him as to me i felt like i met a really cool guy whom i would call one of my best friends we laugh at the same jokes share some similar interests and i find him inspiring i guess what i am seeking is advice on how to approach him about this just because lately i feel like there is a gap between us that i try to close by talking to him more but i just do not know

1,hi everyone i am new and feeling kind of lost and shy to introduce myself a little i am a year old female up until about a year ago i would never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness though all of the other women in my family have depressive tendencies suddenly i started to feel differently in my mind a feeling which has gone on getting worse and worse the last four months in particular have been a downward spiral i moved house from a big city to a small village late last year and i am not dealing with the change well i do not know anyone in my local area and i do not drive so i am stuck in this little isolated world i work from home i lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people i tend to organizerun everything in our household so basic routines have just fallen apart and my longterm relationship is under strain my partner does not understand how i feel while i resent the fact that he is making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help my family and friends are miles away and i do not feel able to talk to them this last week i found out my mum is having tests run for breast cancer i know it is early days but it is just the last little thing that has pushed me over the edge i am walking around either in a state of complete grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery unable to react to anything in a rational way i have not left the house for days because i hate the village where i live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack i have had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where i live but it will be weeks before i can get an appointment i know that i need to go and see a gp and get some medication but i do not have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village and i am just so exhausted all the time the internets my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment if all this sounds familiar to anyone please reply it would be a lifeline for me thanks wizzy
0,thoughts on multifamily and multigenerational households and family disagreements basically i married into a filipino family and my mil owns a fairly large chunk of farmland she routinely expresses a desire for all of us myself my wife our two kids my sisterinlaw and her husband my brotherinlaw his wife and his kid to build a large house with a large living area each of us read each family would get our own rooms everyone would live together and we would all be one big happy family except not i have a number of reasons for saying absolutely not maybe it is my pov as someone that was raised in america but i value independence and privacy i want my own life and my wife feels the same having family involved in everything you do always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell no thanks it is be really easy if her mil was not a good person but she is probably the most kindhearted person i have ever met she is always there to help us out financially or if we need anything else we are there for her the best we can too of course so it feels really bad to turn it down especially since i understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face and there is the financial aspect since the land is already familyowned acting disinterested does not work anyone else have family that has tried this

1,i do not really know what i am doing here but i think i better get this out because it is driving me crazy and i really need to do something and stop thinking is it normal to be reaching out i think that in the past looking back i have tried to reach out and every time it just got screwed up i feel stupid but i think it is like i need to know that someone knows that i am in pain is that rrlike normal the first time i wrote a letter to friends school found it and called my guardian i then was forced to a doctor who i lied to and ran away from as if nothing ever happened next it was an email school found out school counselor persuaded principal for her to deal with it went to another doctor and ran away from it once more now i have left school no school counselor anymore with shit still going on and me still not dealing well with it since then i have spent so much money on credit where i started to message wrong numbers accidentally how lame is that i still talk to one lady that replied who also suffers depression one night it went too far and i ended up being taken to hospital because of what i wrote and now i am here do you think that this stupid reaching out will stop if i go to a doctor or counselor is this what my problem is that i need to know someone knows i am in pain why do i feel like this anyone

0,group of friends exclude one person and now stuck i between so i have a group of about friends some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past years one friend always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she be part of the group anymore as she making any effort and she was being a drama queen she definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story i totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it the loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me there are a few that i will never again consider a friend going forward my dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group i enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and i am also friends with the excluded friend i feel that i either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few either way i feel awful i really know the purpose of this post but i really have any other friends so if i break away from this group i have any left apart from the other excluded friend not sure they really are my friends anymore as they been there for me recently so i suspect be next on the chopping block anyway

1,my purpose for posting this is that i am at a dead end and do not know where else to turn i am and i am sure have been suffering from depression most my whole life my life has been one failure after another in relationships jobs and anything else i had been on antidepressants for about years and then stopped after i got arrested for a dui and felony hit and run the man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when i split the scene that was the whole extent of his injuries after the arrest i was feeling so bad it made no difference whether i took them or not the charges were dropped but i had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me which my attorney was sure they were going to do that was years ago and i think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me i just lost my job in my probationary period of months i have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself ba in psychology technical degree in computers numerous computer certifications but where ever i go i do not fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go some many failed romantic relationships never having friends and what family members i have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support most nights i calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide i feel like a freak physically i shortened my fingers on my right hand by inch and my hand is deformed because i hit the wall in my apartment one night about years ago after i was let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time of course what i have stated so far is not close to all that is weighing on me now i am just so tired and hopeless i do not know how to get the energy to try again any encouragement or wisdom the read you can provide is very much appreciated if you need to something that is hurtful please do not respond to this

0,adventures always start in the most unlikely ways a random email from someone with the courage to think outside the box thanks si has tempted me to dip my toes in the world of the weblog i do not know where this will lead if anywhere but a chance to unjumble some of the thoughts racing round my head can only be a good thing i think everyone reaches a point where they have to stop and say is this really the life that god has mapped out for me or am i just imposing his hand on my own faltering steps down the expected path it is not that i think i am in the wrong place physically i just think maybe i am on the wrong level i think the catalyst has been the birth of my daughter two big blue eyes watch every move i make with unnerving concentration taking in the things other people may have glossed over in the past suddenly i realise that what i say may count for very little as seeing everything she is going to see the truth do not get me wrong there are lots of positives i am just ready for more i suppose i am just looking for a way to let my mind spill on to the screen and see if what lands there starts to make some sense

0,these are just a few of the poems that i have written in my past granted they have not the greatest but in my eyes they are also not the worst i hope if who ever does read these enjoys them this first one i truely like carpe noctem by c kevin mcbroom spinning yarns and spinning tales of creatures of the night and of banshee wails they say monsters do not exist or at least so it seems tell that to a small boys cries or a little girls screams as a clawed paw falls quietly with each step behind its opaque eyes many secrets are kept the small creature stalks the night of the moon with nie a sound with a smell of doom a light through a window spurs the small beast on moving swift ever silent for inside is food to feast on a light scratch at the window followed by a stifled cry is only a small kitten wanting in from the cold outside true thoughts by c kevin mcbroom tired of peoples attitudes treating me as if i am in their servitude people just understand just because not exactly as they have planned i feel as though looked down on try as hard as i might even when i win i won sometimes i want to open that final dark door if i do would i finally win friends fall wayside as do lovers once again i am all alone walking solemnly through the clover pictures race through my mind i try not to look is it because afraid of what find better off left alone and silent no one to worry or care about no one for my heart to be sent tears fall but i laugh in spite i close my eyes to hide myself and finally give up the fight personally i have always thought that one was kind of depressing all suicidal and stuff but for some odd reason i still like it seasons by c kevin mcbroom in the sleepy summer sunset i remember your bright eyes reassuring and softly staring reflective of the clearest blue skies during the wild winter winds as the snow covered the ground we walked hand in hand at night you chased away the cold dark shroud in sunfilled spring days your lovely laughter filled the air as we rolled in and over the clover life was without a single care in the sleepy summer sunsets i remember your bright eyes i wrote that last one for my now wife i know it is sort of corny and hallmarkish is that a word but i like the picture it brings to mind and it is probably the least syrupy poem that i wrote to her

0,imminent death of a loved one so let me start by saying been fortunate enough to have never lost a family member or really close friend so this is all foreign to me my grandpa has had cancer for quite a while and getting worse whenever i visit something that is never really talked about and he seems to not really want to talk about it and really let any of us know what is going on and down plays the situation recently picked up on several indicators that lead me to believe the end is near i really know what the best thing to do is but i know one thing and that i want to miss any moments let him down in his last days or regret anything for the rest of my life he has lived a long and extraordinary life and has so many stories and so much wisdom one thing is that i want to be able to tell my future kids about him and carry on that legacy after he passes and there are many stories that i myself recite and many that i am sure that i even heard i guess what looking for is maybe someone who has gone through this sort of thing and can share maybe some things that they did or wish they done before their loved one passed away two things kind of come to mind but i know how to bring it up maybe to have him write some things down in a journal or to record something also just open to hearing anyone stories thanks in advance

1,i did not expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume i made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression i mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who do not what i did not imply was that i wanted that just for the sake of curing my depression and that is what another member tried to pin on me he or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you are depressed how i should go seek therapy and that i should realize that relationships am not a magic cure i do not want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression i am going to therapy taking antidepressants for years now and i am fully aware being with someone is not a cure i was with someone while depressed for years i wanted to reply to this person to explain they misunderstood me but i was too upset so i deleted the post perhaps my wording was not good enough but still such a judgemental approach to answering someones post on a depression subreddit is in my opinion very saddening just wanted to share this now take it as you will

1,working on a new appstartup to help you guys please read this i would really appreciate any helpfeedback hello everyone a current sophomore in college studying computer science and this summer i decided to work on a new app that caters to depressedsuicidal people who are going through bad times i want this app to connect depressed users to people who are volunteers at crisis centers or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users this app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live and you can see their face and any user can instantly connect with them first the user will enter their information like what their favorite tv showsmoviesmusic artists are where from and what type of gender feel most comfortable talking to all this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fits those preferences the user can swipe through all of the options that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteers to a list that like to come back to i want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn hisher camera on or if not just use the microphone or if they want to do either of those options they can just use the chat box provided i want it to be a social platform where users can connect with other users and see what doing basically a user is becoming friends with their and other users as well also these oneonone sessions can be changed to a room where there can be users to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a i dare dream of making any money from this app and i know i need funding from to get this thing skyrocketing that is why i am getting all the resources i need from my entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people i need to know i hate to say it but if i need to make shareholders money then do it but i want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic this may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this appcompany is to have a box filled with goodies being mailed to users when the day birthdays come around that include lettersvoice messages from volunteers saying or or followed by more messages that has to do with the user this box will also include a lot more goodies that has to specifically do with the user i used to be like you guys i say that i suffered as much as you guys but i came to this sub a couple of times when i had no one else to go to i had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why i think this app could actually mean something to someone please we need to try and put an end to the huge suicide rate among childrenadults in america please provide any feedback whether good bad or helpful anything helps really i can also answer any questions you might have about this app please excuse my bad grammar a computer science major for a reason haha

1,feeling numb realized that if i talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here i am on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low i even seen the paper and already i feel as if lost i never thought i would reach such a low in my life something weird happened today i finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced that seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way the only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes i know my life truly mine and that if i hurt myself then i also hurt other people but just getting too much the thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year i was feeling optimistic about to come but that lasted all of one month the future i was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me i try very hard to keep my guard up near people i know and love but becoming harder and harder to do so i used to think that i was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional getting harder to keep the tears in whenever i used to feel numb i used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now all i want to do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but i know if i have the strength left to do that getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while afraid of myself of what i might do if things go my way i know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is how can anyone recover from such a failure gotten so bad that i would much rather prefer that i disappeared than having to tell my parents wrong depression is nothing new for my university and it be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now i know why they did what they did the pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine is just too much to handle almost inclined to reveal my name just in case able to figure out who i am and i can finally get the respite i desire so much all around me i see happy faces and i can only hope that one day i can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime i guess i just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel
1,i really need some advice trigger warning trigger warning hi everyone i am sorry if i am doing this wrong this is my first time visiting this subreddit and so i do not know what is generally expected or done on here let me just get into this i am and i have never experienced depression i am a psychology major and i have taken classes over the topic but i know reading about it can only give me so much insight the reason i am posting on here is because i have a year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day she is depressed says she wants to die and i am so so worried about her she lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now but i plan on going out to visit her this weekend to be honest she has a horrible living situation my aunt her mom is awful to my aunt every problem can be solved by god she is financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins and she is extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings needs and emotions it also does not help that my cousin is adopted and i know she just feels detached from her own family anyways i know that there is no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression i know how complex of an issue this is what i want to know from you all is if there is anything i can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better my little cousin has always looked up to me and i plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do like go to the park make slime whatever year olds like but is there anything extra i can do is there anything that you all wish someone told you or maybe even something you wish they did not i would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend i know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her but i want to do anything i can to make it easier thank you tldr my year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself i am going to visit her this weekend is there anything i can do or should not do that might at least show her that things can get better

1,life be this miserable overwhelming anxiety is ruining me
1,does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more dramatic than it actually is i always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and i dramatise it in my own mind it is as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression as it least it gives me some kind of identity i imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort i can it is pretty toxic but it is one of the only ways i can deal with it does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing
1,i have fallen back into a depression and missed a week worth of school now i am behind and my parents have not even cared to ask me about it
1,i want to open up and talk to you but my brain tells me it will just make it worse if i do that is my life in a nutshell unfortunately i know i need to open up and talk through any issue that may come up but in the back of my head there is a voice telling me that if i do it will only make it worse and the fucked up thing about it is that the voice is right of the time because most people in my life do not percieve the things that bother me as actual issues fuck everything about communication it only makes things worse i honestly do not need anything else adding to the massive weight i bear
1,i am losing my mind and do not know where to put it for safe keeping if only i could just put it in a little box wait for the insanity to subside and then take it out and it would be unharmed lately i feel as though i have been more crazy than usual i cannot stand human contact not just from my wife but from anyone a handshake a hug anything i just tense up and cannot breathe what the is wrong with me yet i lay in bed wanting her to hold me but when she does i cannot breath it has nothing to do with how she is cuddling up against me it is just how i start to feel i hate feeling like this because it makes her feel like she is less than desirable or that she did something wrong she did not i still love her i need her i would be dead wo her that is for sure the good doctor is on vacation this week i may leave her a message about this latest issue just because i know myself i will not bring it up next time i see her and then it will continue to bother me it is like i need to go in w a list pinned on my shirt of things i would really like to talk about because i get there and i cannot speak and i hate the awkwardness of sitting there staring into someones eyes knowing there are things you should be saying but you cannot i will get over it i always do that is my motto and i am believing it less and less lately oh well monday will be here in min and i need to go to bed see you tomorrow

0,ending a year friendship over her husband i am not sure how i feel about my behavior and considering ending our friendship because of it a little backstory known her almost years we met through our boyfriends our exes now and we used to do double dates and a lot of coupley activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that she and i stayed friends despite the breakups with our boyfriends at the time but our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule she usually works hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for months so i always get to see her or hang out as much as i would have liked but kept in touch through social media always expressed a desire to hang out more like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but either too busy or financially strapped to do it so typically we either see each other on our birthdays and about it the problem having is that married to this guy she met years ago and been single for years i have a fwb who been in a with for months i kept that a secret from her because not a real relationship and not sure if ever become one met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and i were out at a store ever since she became aware of his existence been pressuring me to plan like going to the driveins to see the new star wars movie or coming over to their house for redbox movies and dinner i already told her not really the type of relationship that i have mentioned the idea of all of us hanging out to him casually to see if be interested but he want to do it when i told her that i rather she and i just go to the movies together or night over at my place she said she because she wants to spend time with her husband when not busy working i feel like not really going to spend time with me unless i give in and do activities i just feel like she and i are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it would be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who does not seem to want to do things just the two of us is it wrong of me not to want to be friends because of this

1,doctor taking me off meds cold turkey hi everyone i have been on prozac fluexetine since grade i am a year student in college now for the past few years i have been upped from to and now i have been on mg for years when i went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that i was comfortable with my medicine and dosage so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy during my last visit i expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual but instead he said he was prescribing me more months of mg prozac then making me stop cold turkey because being on prozac for more than months is bad i do not understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping i once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the week i had attempted suicide and addressing the months he promised i was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given month of medicine for me i have been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after i got raped and beaten because i drank a lot of alcohol for a few days i have been to several therapists i have been rationing my pills every days and my mother and fiancée who i live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior i feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but i am still depressed i do not know what to do when i have no more antidepressants after years and then going cold turkey i am afraid my brain chemistry will convince me to do something stupid and damaging to myself again

1,severe ibs and depression combo is a death sentence hi i posted a few times on this forum last year april sometine due to my depression and i am posting again because well it is back so i am just going to write a few things about myself and why i am posting here i am a year old guy from london england and i have been depressed for about years now i was also diagnosed with ibs about or so years ago i was at university for digital media and i finished my first year but when the second year started my ibs symptoms got worse and i was i physically unable to go thankfully the university gave me a year off and said i can start my second year next year after i get better however it just seems to be getting worse not better i can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which i need to go home to go toilet for when it was really bad i would feel very faint and start having panic attacks it reached the point where i was practically housebound i spent like months playing games watching anime and tv shows and the pains started to get a bit better then days ago i went toilet and it happened again severe pain feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression the waves just hit me i began feeling hopeless again i felt unsatisfied with life not just my life but life in general thanks to my love of anime webnovels games and movies i started to wish my life was like that i know it is childish but deep down it is just how i felt i could not accept reality it was too mundane for me and i was not satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things but i could not do anything about it because everytime i try to do something my ibs kicks in and basically cripples me and i know that even if i try and do something it is not really what i want i do not want my life to be normal all i would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen i know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you do not really understand it but i just felt like i really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me i guess you could say i am looking for friends who can understand me i am hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if i have people to talk about the things i love with who also understand what it is like going through depression that is the conclusion i came up with anyway thanks for reading
1,please share with me what you do to feel less depressed hello i wanted to talk to somebody else that the people i know in real life i have really good friends and most of my family supports me but i do not have the courage to talk to them about how i feel i know they have their own problems they have to deal with and i do not want to put any more pressure than they already have i have been struggling with this since i was about or i had alot of stress in my life since i work since i was little i have never had a relationship with someone and i am pretty touch starved but i just want somebody to talk to because everyday is getting worse every day i wake up and do not know why should i keep living keep trying to get my shit together why do i matter as a person why even keep giving hopes to the people around me because i am always there when they need me but i am too ashamed to ask them for help because in my head if i do so i feel like they would see me diferently and not respect me anymore i just want somebody that i cannot talk to at peace just talk please

1,i have realized that i made a big mistake by starting this blog it serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view so i have deleted the entries from the last six months i was going to explain some things but thought better of it i think a small part of my old self has awakened again i am a bit ashamed of all the whining i have done here i am embarrassed that i have sought out people in my life for emotional support when i should have dealt with things privately on my own when i lost my mind to grief i forgot everything that i knew as the old adage goes you come into this world alone you live alone you die alone you solve your problems alone needs to be added the intense pain of grief can warp your mind impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret i am sorry if i have upset anyone but my intention was simply an attempt at selfhelp not to change the world i was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain i have always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and i thought i had expressed that before i never thought anyone had an expectation that i would contact them or would even really want me to contact them i am after all a stranger to those who have read my words i was getting to the point where i was starting to consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments just to thank them but now i think that it is better that i do not this is the old public version of me writing to day i have pushed most of the real troubled me back down into a box for a little while i have resolved only to let her out when i am alone in this blog i did dwell on many of the same things again and again but i was surprised that i could actually find some release by repeatedly talking about the same thing i think this will be my last entry so goodbye and good luck
1,can depression impede articulacy obligatory i have been living with depression and anxiety for much of my life as a young adult it is been stronger than it ever has the past year and a half and i have noticed many things about myself that am not in line with who i thought i once was one of the most significant is how i sound to myself and others i used to actively attempt to expand my vocabulary as well as possess an ability to articulate my thoughts but it seems these days i am just drawing blanks most of the time i feel like an idiot and inferior to others
1,describe your depression here is how i would describe mine i live an exceptionally fortunate life i am a college student interning for a commercial real estate development company i had two internships last summer one in venture capitalism and one teaching middle schoolers how to code i have a potential internship lined up for a fortune company in miami next summer and potentially an private equity internship lined up i have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful but i feel so unhappy and miserable with my life my thoughts are so irrational and negative that i cannot see how fortunate i am to have all that i have i make great money with my summer internship more money then most adults make but none of that matters because i still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday i feel hopeless all day everyday i feel unloved and unwanted even though i have more than enough to be grateful for i still feel inferior and lower than the lowest of the low

0,am i in a bad friendship i have this friend and he is actually really fun and quite an extrovert he is cheerful most of the time but the thing is he has anger issues and he gets pissed off at people and stuff easily including me whenever i play games like league of legends with him he gets so mad at me for stuff that i did not even do and even at one point filed a complaint and wrote stuff that was completely false about me and i used to ask him questions sometimes via text and he would always respond but then he would say you could have at least said hi so one time i just said a simple hi to him and you know what he said i am really not in the mood for a pointless hi and he seemed really moody to me especially for some reason and then he typed something you know i really do not know why you bother i could not read the rest because he deleted it but what is weird is he still wants to play league with me and stuff which i find stupid because i know he is just going to get angry at me again and only me he never gets angry at anyone else he plays with in that game and it makes me feel sick so i just stopped messaging him in general and one time he said you know i do not know why i am so aggressive to you so let us just forget that happened and i did not say much and he said i know you do not have much to say and i do not care so let us just forget he did not even say sorry for being so mean to me to me it just looked like someone that was trying to clean up the pile of junk he left so he does not need to think of it later it makes me feel so sick to think of and sometimes he calls me a bitch and a hoe like really why would you call your friend that i never called him anything like that one time he was trying to talk to me and a bunch of other people were talking over him so i could not hear him then he said yo bitch i really wanted to punch him in the face that was really hurtful like i have a name cannot you at least say my dam name sometimes i just hate him so much and its sad because he is a fun person but he just gets stupidly pissed off and says whatever he wants without thinking how hurtful or rude it is

0,how to befriend someone i had an awkward past with i had this female friend that i met almost two years ago both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first but my introverted mind did not help with that after a while i started to have feelings for her and i started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward i used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that i was annoying her i knew that a couple of months later i knew that something was up and that i made her upset but i never really knew what it was i tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that i want to date her she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age after a year or so is when i figured out that i made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that i wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else i had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what i wanted from her but i keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time i think about doing it what do you guys think i should do some might say that i should leave it behind but i did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life i have never met someone so true genuine and wholesome in my life so i cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me would appreciate hearing from you people by assisting me thanks a bunch

0,roomie read a text i sent about her on another friends phone so i am going to delete this right after but i kind of fucked up bad i am a yo female btw living in an apartment w other ppl ok so i came home from a stressful night and one of my roommates was drunk af i left to go see a friend for a bit and when i returned there was a pot of mac and cheese sitting on the stove with the burner on high and no one was around turns out drunk roomie started cooking then abandoned it there what annoyed me more was that it was my mac and cheese she cooked and burnt i understand we get drunk and we take our roomies food it happens ok i have done it rarely but yeah it happens i was mainly annoyed that the stove was on high and left unattended while she went out partying if i would not have come home it could have started a fire so me being the idiot i am i sent a text to our other roomie just explaining that i was a bit annoyed that our other roomie left the stove on and was also using my food wo asking it was not shit talking in my opinion as the text legit said i just came home and left the stove on and burnt food and left it there and it was also my food so i am a bit annoyed me and said roomie had been talking earlier about how we were a bit annoyed she came home so drunk and loud i legit just said i was a bit annoyed bc she left the stove on and used my food but i was not like incredibly mad i was just venting bc i know i would get over it in an hour and just tell her tomorrow not to leave food unattended or ask if she would like to take some of my food so heres where i am dumb my other roomie left her phone in the kitchen and the message must have popped up or the other girl was snooping through her phone and saw it she then proceeded to text me bitching me out and sending awful passive aggressive texts i remained calm and mature and just explained that yes i was a bit annoyed but i did not send the text to be malicious or shit talk and that i was not mad at her she turned it all around on me and now i am left feeling like the mean person the only person i normally vent to about friends is my sister and no one else i do not like shit talking but everyone gets annoyed and needs to vent from time to time it is healthy to get it off your chest and i did not mean for her to see it also it was not a mean text or anything and also she was the one to disrespect me so i feel i had a right to be annoyed though i should not have sent that text but it could be a lot worse what do i do now she is so mad and ignoring me ugh

0,is not it strange how well life is going perfect yuo never take time to thank god for everything that you have but then the second you lose something you either blame it on god or beg him to give it back or when you do have something you want you go to god and ask him to do it all for you is not it strange how when you have alot of friends to talk to you do not care about the people who mean most to you but then when you lose all your friends you try and turn back to the ones who care about you even though you ignored them and treated them like jerks is not it strange that the things you seem to hate most in life are the things that will help your life like doing math homework or getting grounded for failing a science test that you did not study for to begin with is not it strange how sometimes your worst enemie becomes your best friend and your best friends sometimes become your enemies is not it strange how when someones so happy with the thing they have you start to get jealous insted of being happy for them then start to want something just because someone else has it is not this just all so strange

0,my story of elder abuse internet romance scams and the devastating consequences i am living a nightmare watching a woman years younger than my father coerce him into marriage manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of love the relationship started as ghanaian romance scam and after we uncovered it was a male in ghana pretending to be an american woman it eventually led to a ghanaian woman residing in cuba showing up at my fathers doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later the story is long complex and out of this world so i will not go into it here we have tried it all fbi usiceimmigration state dept aarp private investigators the district attorney police adult protective services elder abuse attorneys and filing for conservatorship the harsh reality i am learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone i am told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves my father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle to the outside world he comes across as just fine but my normally mildmannered extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes personality changes impulsive behavior and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again he cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him i have had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the usa along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage no matter how corrupt i am not writing for advice since i know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father i know and love what i want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family and romance scams or partner abuse in particular i want to hear your story i am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the usa and internet romance scams are only on the rise there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders thank you

1,ever just sit there and wonder what is the point is it all really worth it the hard work at the job on you are self and whatever else i mean if this is all i am going to be as a person even after all this hard work what is the point at the end of the day the only thing i really end up looking forward to is sleeping it is honestly the only time i feel okay it is all gone when i sleep i am at peace my mind is not running through everything that makes me feel like trash is it worth it to continue working as hard as i do at work all i ever do is get shafted or picked on what about going to therapy is it worth it to keep going i mean yeah i have someone to vent to and they listin to me they do not tell me things like you have no reason to feel this way or things like that i mean i really do not see a way out of this place what am i going to find to make it go away some days are bearable but some days i just wish i could stay in my dreams all day sleeping no hurting just peace if got a few new things to bring up to my therapist in two weeks i guess thanks for reading

0,this is the first time i ever done one of these it seems a little awkard for me considering i am such a shy person but i feel its something that i need no one listens anymore its like there deaf to everything i say i am going unheard its a really painful feeling i heard a song today by story of the year anthem to out dying day it was a song that appealed to me in no sort of reason but i still felt compelled to do something i have listened to it nonstop for about hours and it still has not gotten old for me its a new one for me considering i like songs for about a week then never listen it for awhile i do not know what but it appeals to something in my life something i have been wanting for awhile her she is one of the most perfect people i have ever seen i my life she lights up my entire life when ever i am near her its like nothing i have ever felt and it aches because i cannot tell her how it feels how will she react she is the type of person that is not very open like me i cannot just tell her hey i love you baby that just will not cut it for me and for her it seems like she wants something more in a relationship something i am trying to find and seem to have found but cannot tell her will she reject or rejoice i know it seems like a cliche type of love story but that is just the way this story is i wish she would just run into to my arms and say i love you and nothing is never going to change that my heart grows heavy when i see her with other people other men i always feel like my window is closing to her like i will miss my shot and i will i just cannot do anything about it i will not too but i just cannot i do not want to ruin what we already have i keep thinking that she will freak out and our relationship will never be the same with her its a solitary confinement for me no windows only a door which i am afraid to open afraid to see what is on the other said something lies beyond the door that i want too see but i am afraid too what happens if disater lurks beyond the door

0,i was just watching apocalypse now and i have realised that napalm is your friend your very best friend and she will care for you she just wants your soul first heres how to make her the last time i made it mine was very basic part gasoline to parts animal blood this solidified into a type of gel not very stable a bit like me but lethally flammable and sticky but a revised method is to pour some gasoline into an old container and force it to eat up styrofoamyou can even use the little white balls from the inside of a bean bag untill it will not take anymore this dries into a form of foam itself with a wet slice at the bottom tie some into a soggy ball and wrap with cling film to seal it and you have a perfect pocket rocket for throwing into a car window or something else that wants to burn you could even hook up a basic fuse into it and run away very fast indeed because if you have tied the cling film on tightly enough it will just explode big time superb

1,i walked out of a job yesterday i took my dream job in early january only to discover that it is not my dream job at all i thought i would like working in a medical office but this particular medical office has two doctors one parttime staff member and a cluster of other problems i quit on friday the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet and i did but i did not stay long because she did not show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened i have compiled a list of why i quit heres a short sample i hate the hours days a week days a week an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitmentdedication there are religious currents including periodic prayer meetings throughout the day i was treated dismissively when i objected and stated i am not religious the owner is okay with the prayers and says it brings staff closer together i was offered a management position but after being hired was told i know nothing and might manage eventually but right now was incapable of doing so i was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing keep rooms clean and do therapies and run the front desk staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for pr events i know that quitting was the best decision sticking it out would have been detrimental to my mental health and i would have had no time to interview for other opportunities still at the same time i cannot help but feel like a burden to my husband after leaving yesterday i hiked miles to the top of an area mountain really just a big hill it is a foothills mountain and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not i intended to jump i intentionally did not take my gun with me because i never know i am afraid of being a disappointment and i am afraid of never being a conventional functional human i am second guessing my decision to leave i already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and i am lucky enough to have some money put away but i do not want to be a failure i can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again and i am trying to fend them off i forced myself into a perdiem position today just to keep in a routine i am trying to reframe this as an opportunity but right now it feels like a literal nightmare
0,school sux i saw dennis today and he somehow had the nerve to tell me i still owe him money now what the fuck kind of shit is that i do not know that jes pisses me off he has no right to ask for any kind of compensation after that he took the money out of me in physical pain as well as hospital bills and the pure fact that he could be owing me money a whole lot quicker with one call to the cops dennis sit back realize how cool about this i have been and give me a motherfucking break i am still paying goddamn court fees from before and i do not have a fucking job so just accept me being cool and what you did payment enough whatever sbullshit so neways on a different note i was glad i got to talk to sarah last night i feel bad tho because i cannot help but feel bad for being the person who came between her and tina todays just a generally bad day and all i can hope for is for it to start going better sometime
1,i do not know what my problem is hello i have never posted here before i am a year old guy and have a decent job that i like it is quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and i am pretty good at it i have never had a ton of friends because i am very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships but the friends i do have are outstanding and i would not trade them for anything i am kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue i got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it would get them to not make fun of me i think it just kind of stuck i do not know if any of that information is really important just wanted to give it in case that is something that people do here for at least years i have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head all the things that i used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games i just cannot do anything anymore it is like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts occasionally i pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and i do not really know why to be honest i do not know if i like the pain or maybe i like having something else to focus on for a minute or just to feel something that is not apathy for a moment i think about dying sometimes why we are here what is the point if it ends the same i doubt i would ever kill myself because there are things i care about here that i would not leave behind like that mainly my mom and brother i worry my brother will end up like me is there anything i can do i do not know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works i think the brain is so complex that it could not but i guess i do not know i do not want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore i have also always kind of thought that it is human nature to feel this way that everybody gets down gets bored thinks about their mortality etc and that i am just being soft and need to suck it up life is difficult i just need to learn to deal with it maybe i do not know what is going on but i do not like feeling like that if i am hanging out with friends or family i am usually fine it is being alone with myself and having time alone where i cannot entertain myself and waste away i cannot really explain it does anyone else feel like this what helps you i have never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling i would be eternally grateful is this what depression feels like and i have just been in denial about having it for years

1,told my mother i tried to kill myself she admitted she also tried when i was a baby i have been struggling with this sickness for a while it cost me my job and a few friends but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the of february i tried to hang myself with a belt fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame i have always been an outgoing funny talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce after some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this i went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i have been writing above also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness after we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb she had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same the thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with and years alone she also told me that my grandfather did not die of cancer apparently he was an alcoholic and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard all this just made me realize that people do not kill themselves depression kills people the same way cancer does people who have not struggled with this cannot even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill my mother also gave me the best advice i have ever recieved she told me that i was not on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things that it did not matter if i did not find a huge reason to live just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy the same way she was for me that even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds and that should be enough thanks for listening guys

0,sad my friends told mi tat i had help a guy who was out to take advantage of gals the guy is a classmate and a friend of mine althought i was not close to the gal but he wanted mi to put in good words for him as my friends had told the gal negitive comments about him i helped him cos i felt that he was true to mi and was a worthy friend to help but that was only a point of view of mi of a guy so i am not sure about others mostly the gals i also donnoe about his past about his relationships wif other galfriends so i didt made much comments about him on tat anyway i do not reaili care about others past as what is past has past and what is important is now and the future so i placed my trust on him from what i had heard i think tat the gal is not mutual enough to start a relationship

0,my friends fall out with the rest of the group as we agree with them on genders just going to get straight to the point i have these two friends call them ava and chloe who fall out with me and the rest of my friends as they believe more that two genders and the rest of us believe that not saying they believe that but just saying the way that they act when we say we is bad they usually talk to us the day after and act like nothing happened but it bothers me so a summary of what happens someone brings up the topic of genders and then will say how they think two then either ava or chole will get mad and will storm of or start shouting at us ava once called my boyfriend a minded simply because he said he agree with her if they believe that more than two genders i am totally ok with that just that they try and make the rest of us believe it too and then put the blame onto us and starting to bug me so if anyone knows what i can do about this be really glad if you could help me out thank you for reading
1,does anyone else miss the person they used to be i have always struggled with depression but sometimes it is more manageable than other times i have noticed that with every new year and myself getting older i begin to look back on my past and long for it even sometimes breaking down because i miss the person i used to be i am so still young but i really wish i could go back and be again because that was when i was truly happy i had moved out of my hometown had lots of friends a good relationship i lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever i traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival i loved life i had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and i had a lot of fun now that is all over i really only have one good friend left from those times and he does not even live near me anymore sometimes i get really down when i think about old friends and start thinking about things i could have said differently that might have prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship i really never knew how much i needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives my relationship fizzled out in the same way and i have yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again i have also gained all my weight back and cannot stand to look at my own reflection i do not know how to be happy like i was again i look at old pictures from times past with old friends destinations i went too and i want to cry because i just wish i could go back i am so depressed and hate myself i am incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person i used to be it is like i am mourning my past life or something
1,i do not even know i do not know if i am depressed or just the good ol sad i cannot fully express how i feel because the inside of my head is a mess i do not want to give what i feel everyday the label of depression i feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression i have no idea where to get any help for whatever i feel if i did i would either be too lazy or too shy to ask i am too lazy everything is just too tedious in everything i do halfway through it i just feel an intense urge to give up and i do i cannot find a proper hobby to distract myself from whatevers inside my head i cannot focus it is so hard to focus on anything i just stared at the blinking blue bar for minutes just to type this unecessary sentence because i lost whatever i wanted to write here in the maelstrom of thoughts inside my head i used to be smart or atleast feel smart lately i feel like i have dumbed down questions that i used to answer easily became hard for me english something i was proud of for learning it by myself became harder for me my memory is not what it used to be i am jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones everytime it pains me that i cannot find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better it eats me inside that i know they are suffering and i cannot make them feel that someone cares when they think that noone does i am a fake i am not sure if any of you will get what i am saying but eh i cannot even understand myself
1,is there a comfort in sadness my therapist my psychiatrist and my parents all say much than i used to be and i am i know that i even think about suicide anymore and i self harmed in a few years but my brain is still fucked up and it always will be i can live with that but not when all these people around me are telling me how happy i am just because better than i was a few years ago mean good better by comparison but it and i hate being told how doing but then i think maybe just overreacting to the word because more comfortable being sad been sad for so long that a certain comfort in it sad is familiar happy is unknown and risky can anyone relate to this or am i alone
0,ultrasoundbiopsy friday i am and i found a lump on my right breast saturday and obviously my brain has been on the hamster wheel ever since i am currently breastfeeding and have experienced clogged ducts and mastitis before but this does not feel like either the lump almost feels like its in my muscle and its not able to move i have no pain associated with it no family history of bc and no other symptom except for an observation by the doctor that my saline implant was more into my armpit than my left the doctor ordered for an ultrasoundother imaging along with biopsy if needed but since i am breastfeeding i cannot get a mammogram the waiting game sucks and my brain is going there and it just sucks because i have kids update my results finally came back and i have extremely dense breast tissue therefore they could not see anything during the ultrasound the doctor recommended that i stop breastfeeding and get a mammogram in months after my supply dries up i of course read up on extremely dense breast tissue and months just seems too far away

0,i dropped an internet friend several months ago and i regret it i met her like almost years ago we were very close internet friends and would talk basically every day she was amazing in real life i had basically no friends she was the only friend i had i am sure this led me to having unhealthy views on relationships i still have unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships anyways the trouble began when on instagram our main chatting platform she began to gain friends from just common interests and such she started posting screenshots of her friends and her dm conversations and how funny they were she then would post screenshots of her group chat conversations and how funny they were all of this would happen and i would still be waiting for a simple reply i did not get it i still do not really get it i was there for her for so long she did not have many friends in real life or online either but once she had gotten these new internet friends she would ignore me she would reply up to three or four days later she also made a whole separate account where she would post as well which she never even told me about and i had to find out myself when she spoke about it on her main account i finally had enough and sent her a long explanation about my feelings and stuff and did not speak to her after that and the funny thing is that she did not reply to my explanation for two weeks and suddenly she was like nooo pls etc typing all of this i lowkey am getting annoyed i just want someone to smack some sense into me like it is been so long and i still think about her it was not like she was a bad friend but she just fuckin ignored me and basically left me i usually think about her when i am feeling lonely or my irl best friend starts to treat me like shit and ignores me but that is a different story right now i am thinking about dming her and just having small talk i feel like it is a bad idea but also it could reunite us and we could be friends again it is probably a bad idea and i probably will not do it though please give me words of wisdom

1,it do not get no better than this last night was a success i was in truly rare form my last nonfuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friends around but highlights of the night include making out with two of my girl friends flashing one of my more reserved friends reaction did she just flash me waking up this morning with a strangers cell phone on my desk a peek through the phone book and i was pretty sure he is not a law student but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed doing way too many shots when after being asked if i wanted to do shots i responded i really should not do whiskey shots bring me the tequila and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication we had a really fun night but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time i think i was still drunk when i went to civ pro this morning hmm the bar we went to is dead on thursday nights though really packed on friday and saturday nights it was nice though we had the bar to ourselves about people showed up and after talking to us for awhile the owner said he would give us drink specials on thursday nights if we came back he even comped a lot of our drinks which was cool we will definitely be back i liked this place already but this is true incentive a couple people are out tonight but i lost my steam after happy hour i just felt too exhausted to even think about going out i made macaroni cheese sat on the couch and watched tv it is been a nice quiet night

0,i am having trouble getting along with someone i want to consider a friend long story short this guy was originally a friend of a friend i will call him jeff we all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends jeff and i got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off while i get the whole friends mess with each other idea but it just does not fly with me and this guy i may mess around with my friends once in a while and i am a big joker but for the most part i just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games go to the gym etc on the other hand it feels that jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he knows it will piss me off i know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but i cannot help it i do not know how to deal with him or get the message across when i tried to sit down with him and talk man to man jeff did not seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics i talked with our other friends who have known him longer than i and they all just told me something along the lines of he does not mean anything by it it is just how he is do not get offended but unfortunately we do not mix that way now jeffs not inherently a bad person when he is serious he is actually a pretty good guy he has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too all of which i greatly appreciate but his behavior to me on a day to day basis just really really pisses me off

0,advice on axillary mass with negative ultrasound findings i just completed an ultrasound for my right breast and left axilla my right breast is a cup size larger than my left as of a few months ago and extremely firm my gp noted a couple areas she felt lumps my left axilla has had a mass for over a year that has recently grown larger my gp said it felt like scar tissue to me it seems like a mass of lymph nodes that has pretty dang palpable my ultrasound apparently showed nothing for both my breast and axilla i am relieved but also really confused as i very clearly have a mass in my axilla but because they saw nothing on my ultrasound they said a mammogram was not necessary do i just let it go and deal with the mass talk to my gp again i am not sure where to go from here
1,how do you get a job after over a year of unemployment f early i never finished college came home and i have been so depressed that i have not done anything since i left school in i am a really hard worker and i have always been liked by my bosses but i do not feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs i have had i kind of just abandoned i would get to a point where i could not handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if i wanted to come back during a break from school and i would never call back now i am in this weird limbo that i do not know how to get out of because i basically do not have any credentials or references and there is a massive gap in my resume that i cannot explain
1,fuck everything amp everyone i decided to make a different account for this because i need to get all of this off my chest i hate myself and i hate my life i feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life and i am not even in my twenties yet i might as well be considering everything i have to do i turned a few months ago and things have only gotten worse my parents are completely delusional and cannot grasp the fact that thet because suffering for their own benefit they would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did even if there was not one my mom is an asshole to put it nicely she is very controlling i have called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them resulting in me having to find a different therapist and doctor twice because they would not take me because of canceling so many times and i still have not found either so no therapy or medication i have next to no friends because of how she is coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety my dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me he hates how liberal i am he hates the people i like whatever i like he probably hates he sits in front of a tv all day watching shit he bitches about anything he can yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he is the main because of no clean dishes i am in the wrong even though he does not rinse his or even bring them to the sink pills went missing he takes more than he is supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage so on and so forth i honestly do not look forward to waking up anymore i can only find peace at night and then i usually get less sleep than i should of course i am lazy for sleeping in more gets done quicker in less time when i get up than the whole time they have been up i hate this stupid town and i hate my life it feels like i am destined for absolute failure school puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too i wish i could go to sleep and not wake up that would be ideal honestly the list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day and i am so so lost on what to do anymore i feel so uncomfortable and just wrong like i know something bad is bound to happen idk i am just confused and scared

1,been depressed for so long that i cannot remember the last time i was myself hey guys this is my first post here and i do not know where else to go i have been in a dark place for a long time but i am the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell i just turned yesterday and i have been depressed for about years now i have not opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse today i realized something that made me genuinely cry i seriously did not remember the last time i was myself i used to be super carefree and relaxed i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds i just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and i am currently finishing my second year its been getting progressively worse in the last months with a serious drop in my appetite i also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon i have lost about pounds in months because of this my grades also took a hard hit going from a gpa every semester to a i just had a talk with my mom and she told me that i am being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father i am not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed i know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cannot keep the darkness out of my head weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track thanks in advance to whoever takes the time to read this long ass fiesta

1,i did something that made me really happy after flunking a test getting yelled at by a classmate sitting alone at lunch with incredible anxiety and spilling milk on my uniform and having to go thru an hour long commute in a really hot day i get home feeling really overwhelmed with tons of homework i remember feeling very numb at the time that i just decided to turn off all the lights in my dorm and got completely naked and played my ukelele i played my favourite song and started crying and just sang at the top of my lungs sounding like a dying whale and it lasted for like hours i could feel every bit of depression and anxiety slowly leak off my body until the water bill knocked on my door
0,my dad is getting older in bad shape and is too stubborn to do anything about it i love my parents but over the past years my dad has been gaining weight and eating junk that has made him become pretty unhealthy about years ago he suffered from a heart attack before i headed to work he collapsed in front of my mom and i had to run out the door and knock on both my neighbors doors since they both new cpr luckily the paramedics came in time and he was able to survive through surgery he is on medication now and all of his tests have come through positive but he is still overweight he is and i realize he is not getting any younger my mother and i have been trying to get him to eat healthier and stop drinking so much he drinks chardonnay every night and a lot of it a week every time we bring it up he immediately diverts the topic to something else and blames us for being negative and to be more positive he says he works too much and that we are just ganging up on him psychologically i believe he is just so stubborn that he will not ever admit to actually being unhealthy and doing something about it he is tried to workout but he never makes much progress i want my dad to live for as long as possible but he is just so incredibly stubborn and toxic about it that eventually i am afraid he is not going to last much longer we are both incredibly frustrated our doctor who monitors him has even told my mother your father is a very nice man but if he continues doing what he is doing you need to raise your life insurance what do i do
0,losing my best friend it feels too heavy right now to type out the details i might try tomorrow but losing my best friend and i have never felt this sad
1,this is how i feel and i have a slight sense i am the only one to think think this way i am depressed help wanted i yearn for the days i was in high school i felt as if i was always happy and never worried about anything i am just having graduated from university it seems each day i am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family i want to be alone happiness to me is being sheltered by realityalone with my thoughts i deleted every single bit of social media i had about a year ago sc fb insta twitter etc in an attempt to become as alone as possible i truly deep down wish i was never born but i would never ever commit suicide i wish more then anything else that i can just disappear and leave this world i am studying for the mcat currently i do not have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality but i find that i enjoy things that take my mind off of reality studying reading listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this but the reality i see is that this world is shit i believe that as a whole humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind most of everything in this world and by humans that obviously includes myself and i hate myself down to the core for the selfish things i have done maybe i am too cynical or something but this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk i reeeealllly question every aspect of life and i cannot help it each time i am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is i guess i can give one example the most recent selfphilosophical argument i had is the idea of wars with murdering others specifically we praise those who fight for our country yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious do people not evaluate the reality they are in do they not question why they believe the things they do am i the only one does someones act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same who is to even say so if they would kill all of us if we did not kill them then what makes our lives worth more that is just one example but then i look at areas like american healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food even the american political system with the deep state and shit why are we even on this damn earth seriously what is the point of everything in life i simply do not view the joys of life being worth living for i just do not understand this whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me
0,it sucks to see someone you love be so stupid but i cannot criticize because i too was an idiot in the past i guess it is true that the people outside of your little love bubble can see the flaws of one of the persons in the relationship i hope to god i am never ever that dumb
1,law of attraction is bullshit also hard work does not pay off everything in life is based on chance and luck only our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs also every fucking motivational coach and selfhelp guide is a fucking scam focusing your goals working hard and putting effort in to achieve them yeah tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better people dying of famine or living in war zones tell that to the legions of people who did not make the cut and never will yeah tell them they just did not work hard enough did not want it enough while you completely ignore how fucking lucky you got to be in the privileged position you are in this world makes me fucking sick and i get sicker every day

1,i get depressed so i procrastinate so i get more depressed etc i hate my job with a burning passion but i cannot bring myself to quit or do anything else my job is prestigious and highpaying so it is the only thing that makes me look successful to family and friends which makes it the only tiny source of selfworth i have if i lost my job everyone would know the useless depressed piece of shit i really am i fucking despise my job though so i cannot bring myself to actually do the work i procrastinate for hoursdays and only get anything done by pulling allnighters right before deadlines i could have an assignment for two weeks and i will still do it from am to am the night before it is due the procrastination makes me even more depressed anxious stressed etc which makes me even less interested in doing my work i know i would be less miserable if i got my shit together but i just cannot make myself do it and then i hate myself even more vicious cycle continues i have tried every trick in the book to stop procrastinating but nothing works anyone else deal with this

0,dealing with an emotionally unavailable best friend i see my best friend a lot i do not wear my heart on my sleeve but i am emotional i definitely give too much in a relationship and end up getting hurt because of it my friend has troubles expressing her emotions and generally gets very annoyed when she has to prove herself because she feels like people should just trust her she does not have many friends because of this i always express my irrational feelings but when she is angry she does not want to say anything because she does not want to hurt me i do not want her to hold anything in but i know that i would suffer because of the truth how do i balance our give and take is there anyway i can help her open up or is that impossible
1,anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person i saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression for me it is the opposite i was always a super joyful kid and maybe a little too hyper i was that annoying kid when i was then around seventh grade i started to withdrawal from the world slightly and just talked a little less than average this seemed all fine at the time it made me a more likable person but i think that was the beginning i finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how i acted when i was younger during third quarter that year it was not bad depression but it only got worse from there my dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year and my mom started to be disappointed with everything i do my parents do not even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they have not held a conversation with me since i was the only person who i can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend and he does not even know i am depressed i do not see a reason why i am so why should i explain that to someone who is much more depressed than i am by the time i turned i can say i was depressed functionally depressed i guess using terminology from one of the top posts here i do not know what to do

0,dear friendship troubles give your friend the weekend to calm down and you should too think of what you might have said wrong to her on monday try and talk to her again do not talk to her and bother too much if she tells you to leave her alone leave her alone but just say to her i understand that you are mad at me but i really think you should listen to what i have to say then if she let us you explian to her that you are sorry and you do not like not talking to her if she does not let you explain resort to the next step write her a note write down everything you would say to her if you were talking face to face tell her to write back or talk to you it might just take one appology but if it does not do not keep bothering her if she does not talk to you for more than a month maybe this friendship was not meant to be if you have any more problems do not be afraid to tell me about them

0,the worst thing a friend has ever said to you i have two stories this was a few years ago it was near christmas time i had gotten my friend a ipod i was planning on giving it to her the week before christmas so a week prior to me giving her the present i take her to the movies i worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free but i got her a few pins we sell we got a photo at the photo booth and we got concessions the total was probably around when i got to paying for the popcorn and candy my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it i jokingly said is her christmas present my friend said that it was the cheapest present should have taken the ipod back after that just to be petty but she had been in a serious car accident that year so i reconsidered that this one was recent we live in different countries she texted me after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules about how lucky to not have a health issue i thought she was just upset with her life but she was evidently mad at me she made it seem like i deserve my masters degree because i work as hard for mine since i have to overcome any health issues the worst thing she said was that i keep bragging about my life but cares about you she tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but i ignored it she somehow assumed i be angry after many texts i told her that i was upset and that i needed space she got upset that i was upset about what she said just because you are sick and your life feels like shit that give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it blocked her without replying sometimes we need to let things go the people who are your friends will never say stuff like this
1,lost the last of my hope for i think that without making the conscious decision to given up i think just reached the point where stopped kidding myself that all or out like people always tell you what i seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything the one who still believes happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise i work at a job in an office doing pointless work that i used to swear to myself in high school and college that never wind up doing days a week i wake up at leave at work from and get home at my house at then i eat dinner with them watch tv with them and they go to bed so i turn in at watch more tv and go to bed myself on the weekends i typically do nothing when i do go out or hang out with a friend we do nothing just sit and watch tv or a movie unless we can find some fictional world we can discuss marvel got star wars etc we even have much to talk about i maybe have friends that i do this with and again not too often i do not currently have nor have i ever had anything even resembling a love life i was foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before i managed to stop kidding myself on that one never had sex with or even kissed a girl the closest thing i ever did was cuddle with a really close friend and i even fucked that up because i overthought everything as always and make a real move and she instantly lost interestgave up on me and now barely even friends anymore an introvert with no desire to change i have no interest in going out to bars clubs or anything people my age for some reason enjoy all i want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need my idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl i love and watching netflix just enjoying the closeness maybe some kissing sex is something i want but not even on my radar right now my life goals can be summed up in saying i want to find my have a kid or two and do what i can to make them and myself happy i just honestly see the path to that reality though nothing matters to me anymore just my parents and i can honestly say that i am safe as long as around because i care more about them than myself however if they were gone tomorrow i think be close behind i just see a path out of this pointless existence that i feel capable of taking i feel like just serving a sentence going through the motions until mercifully done no question really i just felt the need to say it and acknowledge that done with everything tldr done burnt out never been good to me and stopped expecting i see no way to achieve the few things in life i want

1,i have lived with depression since i was little i was molested by my uncle and a family friend and my dad is in and out of prison all the time i am guessing that is where it all started from well when i hit my freshman year in high school i had no friends because i was so shy i walked the halls alone went to lunch alone sat in the back of the classroom alone i sat back there fantasizing about suicide and death and i would cut myself and i actually planned my suicide by this point i was so far out of my mind that i could not take it anymore so i went to my mom i was diagnosed with severe depression and i have been in counseling on and off ever since i am now years old and i have made friends since and i even got a boyfriend well i have not seen my counselor for a while now and in the past few months i feel like my depression is worse than it has ever been so many things have been happening to me that i just cannot take it anymore i lost the friends that i had and i do not even know why exactly my boyfriend just broke up with me after we had been together for two years i have started to cut myself again i want to be dead i know i should go to see my counselor and i tried to make an appointment but i feel it is too late i feel like i am on the edge of a huge cliff and if i get pushed just a little more i am done i do not know what to do i just cannot take it anymore if someone could please just give me some advice i would greatly appreciate it thank you misty
1,i feel like a useless member of my family i may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house but like to think i do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing my wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house car keys laundry tools you name it they will get lost around the house i have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever i go this way i have to be asking her all the time where to find x item this was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day since then i only bring the key of the car that i bring with me well take too long til that one got lost too i needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere i asked her where it was and she responded with have hands and eyes you find i blew my top off i yelled at her that the fact that i have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous she brought up the fact that i could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy i told her i would if she so damn unorganized every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway she is type a personality and i would like to think i am type a i yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much maybe the reason i do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway an unorganized mess i at least do the basics i pickup after dinner i take out the trash this job now goes to my son handyman work i fix plumbing appliances broken doors computers iphones i would like to think that i play my role as a dad as perfect as i can i help with homework i play with my kids all the time i feed them when mom works early or wants to sleep ingo to bed early mad at me and i feel like i am trying my best but my best is not good enough also says i have become obese because of my laziness that one really hurt i try to walkjog a good minutes times a week if i have time i broke down in my car today after seeing some old photos of my kids when they were babies sorry for formatting i am on mobile and writing is not my thing i am more of a numbers guy

1,well i am getting ready to go back to school so i am trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head so far i have been sober for about days and i must say i am not feeling any better some of the problem is probably zyrtec which i am taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused i cannot really think too well and it is making me want to drink drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier there are people who use prozac and other antidepressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do this is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i do not fell good normally i feel like st normally i guess i should let you in on what is really bothering me first ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying night blindness fuzzy vision bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression anxiety and ocd bad allergies acid reflux to be honest most scary one is night blindness trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try it is like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a tv screen i have had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad anyway one of the first things your body will do when it is over exerted is give you fuzzy vision now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin a deficiency maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was which is very rare i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a daily basis my daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life each day i go to work come home eat and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night do not get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks so if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers if anyone has any answers i am all ears
1,does anybody else go for late night walks hoping you will walk into someone who is also feeling the same ways i do not know why it is never even had any romantic thoughts but it is always been a female i always get a sense i will walk into someone going through the same things and somehow we would know and just walk together without even talking but feel okay maybe its just a way to cope with feeling alone but i have not seen daylight in a week so whether its loneliness or a sense of something to come i will continue see you out there

0,my mother is having a double mastectomy on thursday and i need to know what to expect how do i take care of her hi so i found this out yesterday i am pretty poor at emotions and the like so i mostly just shut down i feel selfish i am pretty scared so far we do not really know anything just that she has surgery on thursday and will probably be home by sat and then we wait two weeks for results from that before knowing what the plan is with chemo and radiotherapy i know everyones recovery is different but i really think she is trying to soften it for us which i understand telling me to just be around on saturday and then go back home on sunday i feel like this is a massive surgery she is getting reconstruction done at the same time i just want to be realistic and be able to take the time off work i live a few hours away and cannot drive to be able to care for her it is likely that she will not be able to do anything at all for about weeks right she is fit and healthy in general has anyone gone through this what should i expect obviously making food taking care of house things that is all pretty clear to me but other things will she be able to move at all will she be able to walk up stairs i feel like we kind of know what to expect with chemo but i think the recovery from the surgery is going to worse than we expect
1,advice for getting back in touch with everyday life i think the hardest thing for me and the largest factor i need to address to try and feel healthy again is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present right now days have little to no meaning at all and i am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks months and years as a result of that i feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself the only activities i really enjoy anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle i just want to enjoy the things that i used to enjoy but whenever i try i feel like i am wasting my time are not doing them well enough has anybody gone through something similar and has advice for how they managed to get through it thanks for reading

1,does it ever feel like your friends are not really there i genuinely care for and love my friends so i regularly ask them how they are doing on messenger since they all live so far away i know my friends struggle with depression so i make it a point to contact them and let them know i am here for them but most times i am left on read or get lukewarm responses as though they are annoyed they do not really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how i am doing i hope i do not sound selfish in any way but it just feels weird to care so much for people who do not seem to care that much for you it hurts sometimes that i also struggle with depression but have no one to talk to
1,well i am so please excuse my grammar and spelling well it started almost about yr ago i started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday that is when i discovered cutting myself it started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction i used to be doing it nearly everyday it mademakes me feel like there is nothing wrong well this grew bigger and bigger and i did not tell anyone about it after about months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine it worked only temporarily around months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment i have researched a lot about clinical depression i still cut and i hate it i came right out to my parents and said maybe i enjoy cutting myself when we were in a huge fight my dad turned around and said we do not care if you cut yourself this definitely did not help so right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine i checked the symptoms of clinical depression on and i have of them i need to go see a doctor i know but i just cannot there is something stopping me and i do not know what it is i just want to solve it on my own but i cannot i need help i have also been thinking about committing suicide and doing drugs but my friends that know i cut are stopping me i know i will be missed i just cannot live on anymore i cannot see myself living past can anyone relate to this can anyone help
1,reddit is not a nice place for someone who suffers depression i think it is funny how sometimes we take internet so seriously i have no idea why the rudness of some totally strange person probably between made me so down i think it is because i use reddit a lot as someway of just keep my mind full away from my problems and feelings so when someone makes you feel something it is like a hit of reality escapism is not that great and i am so tired of feeling bad all the time
1,anyone else feel like everyone hates them or is that paranoia i feel like the dark cloud over my head just gives off a shitty vibe that makes people think i do not like them and vice versa
1,for some reason i am never happy anymore it all started a little less than a year ago suicide attempts cutting burning hair pulling slapping basically just wanting to die people tell me my life is not that bad just because my family has money money is not everything also everyone spreads rumors about me and tells me crap to my face my boyfriend is really sweet and i love him but he has a serious anger issue his psychologist diagnosed him with an anger issue and lately when he gets frustrated he sometimes hits me not like really hard but hard enough to leave a mark then later he does not remember doing it i am worried about him and myself i do not want our relationship to end because of our problems and none of my friends understand why i cut and stuff it is not always for attention you know so if someone could please email me at xxx or reply that would be great please talk to me
1,i just told all students i teach i have depression in an email about finals week i am an undergraduate ta at a university in an interdisciplinary class about the brain i absolutely love being a ta but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally i often feel anxious that i am doing a horrible job i sent out this email to all of my students about finals hi everyone these next two weeks will be a really really tough time for all of you i know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch but there are other things i want you to know i the other tas and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want so you should not be either tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as studentsscientists and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person all a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day it is simply one data point and as you should all know by now data point is not representative of the population for many of you you have other finalspresentationsresponsibilities going on and it will be difficult to find time to study for others you may want so badly to study a lot but cannot because you are so stressed and anxious i personally deal with anxiety and depression and i know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind does not work as well as you want it to take care of yourself eat good food get some sleep spend time with people you love so while you prepare for finals these next weeks keep these two things in mind you are all incredibly curious kind intelligent and important people i brag all the time that i get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday and inspire me to be the best ta i can possibly be cheering you on i cannot believe i just told all my students about my mental illness but it honestly feels so liberating to do so it also feels so hypocritical of me to send this because i attribute much of my selfworth to academics and do not practice much selfcare but i felt like this needed to be said
0,i need help with my best friend one of my best friends is starting to act like he hates me lately and i do not know why like a month or two ago he needed advice about this problem he had with a girl he liked and i gave him advice that helped really good but if i ask about it now he gets mad at me and says it none of my business what do i do
1,i tried to get onto the chat room but it will not let me so i will just post my question here in my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic healthy patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results the details of the experiment are not important but what i was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they would not be labeled as crazy so i raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they could not use their real names like how would people know he said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could particularly employers kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town is what he said i wanted to ask more but did not want to press it so my questions are what kind of record does this go on your hospital record your police record when employers do a background check does this show up then i was wondering when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer what comes up everything if they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital do they have that on file is there any way to see what is on your file i am just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what i can do because of my record or if anyone knows how i would be able to find out this information that would be great

1,it is sad that all i look forward to on weekends is getting fucked up not even look forward to more like chasing the temporary relief that drugs once gave me now they just make me feel like shit but i still try in the hopes that it will make me feel better again atleast they help me relax and forget for a little bit

1,is it stress depression or burn out hey a diabetic with autism for the past years i have felt constant fatigue no motivation sleep issues stomach problems bad memory and concentration issues i took antidepressants cymbalta mg before this during months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects but after i quit antidepressants cymbalta mg the fatigue no motivation sleep issues stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life now for years no matter how much rest i get i feel tired even if excercise eat healthy do yoga and meditation my blood sugar levels has been up and down lately but even if they are controlled i feel the same a because could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past years it went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts i do not feel any ups or downs in my life things i used to like to do isles enjoyable i rather stay at home than being social i believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants but the question is if stressed have major depression or simply burnt out i certainly feel that i have a huge major depression my ocd thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar times per day during the past year which also could bring my stress levels up the past year has been very stressful for me work wise but even if i get a weekend of rest i feel rested i have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out i barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore wash my clothes or think about my hygiene i feel tearful occasionally on some days i have thought about taking antidepressants again particularly cymbalta since it worked for me the first time but i have been afraid of taking them instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix vortioxetine mg per day for my depression but the question is i stressed depressed or burnt out anyone have been in a similar case any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix vortioxetine for major depression so afraid of starting to take them but i want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me
1,are there any youtubers that vlog about their mental illnesses i am currently watching domikazee r and maya imaniamani
1,stop and think for a moment it is like stumbling around in the darkness you cannot see you can only feel blinded by the pain of reality you beg it to stop as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger but it is not going to stop no matter how hard you beg your so called friends abandon you because your depression talk has gotten too dark but what is the worst part that you cannot control it that you cannot stop it maybe it is the fact that just maybe just maybe you do not want it to stop you cling onto your pain because after all it is familiar it is been with you for a while you stand upon the dark edge upon the highest edge you could find you feel the wind blow in your face you freeze all the good moments all the good people it all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret what took you to this edge what made you so desperate to take such drastic action while the pain is temporary this thing you are about to do it is permanent stop and think for a moment because no matter how long a storm lasts you still enjoy the rain you still love the sound of thunder
1,i feel sad it is am and i have not gone to bed yet instead i am sitting here at the computer half heartedly trying to be part of the chat room tears falling down my face i feel so sad i cannot even be bothered to reach for my phone to remove the razor from the back or go down stairs for a bottle of wine it makes me feel worse that this is been going on for so long that even the pathetic depressive coping skills have no effect on me pure pessimism not even the chance of some temporary relief through an od or spilt blood why did they seem to offer relief years ago i tried to eat normally today i really tried i failed though i am trying to see myself properly or at least come to the realization that i am not vile and unattractive and obese it still ends up with food all over the toilet i disgust myself so much i disgust myself because i let myself eat i disgust myself because i think as i do and i know that eating should be considered normal but i cannot see it like that i disgust myself because i covered the toilet bowl in bits of chewed up food and stomach acid i do not know what to say any more i wish some one would say that i am going to feel better but i have had that for the last years and i would probably just be cynical any way this post was pathetic i am sorry ruth

0,why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years some family members can make fortune during their lifetime because they were lucky or because they worked hard or smart it matter it is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background there are always and always will be more failures than successful stories why is it happening because of mismanagement there are no other reasons not because they are too old too young too tall or too stupid but because they failed to create a system which can monitor rule manage predict future successes and failures most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently do those families share this knowledge with humanity no way why would they do that they literally rule the world they have all the power and all the money fortunate to collaborate with some of those families what if i ask you would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success many families are struggling in our society they have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have it leads to frustration procrastination apathy and depression because they have been caught in a daily routine day after day month after month no time to think no time to plan no time to review or set goals in my opinion this is the reality for of the human population of the earth is there a solution yes but you have to implement some strategies it includes not only intellectual emotional and spiritual development but financial evolution also without a strong financial fundament it is almost impossible to cultivate wealth in your family in a longterm run to be continued rey

1,i feel like if anyone got to really know me they would find out i am weird and awkward and they would stop wanting to be around me i am terrified of getting close to people but i want friends so i keep doing this dance back and forth of trying to hang out with people then cutting contact before becoming friends as far back as i can remember whenever i have tried to join a group conversation i have gotten weird looks or people not understanding what i am saying i have learned that the less i say the less awkward people will be around me and i hate it
1,school failure i think i am doing something wrong i found myself in a situation where i was lucky to move to prosperous country except i am with no degree no proper work experience just some odd jobs i am an embarrassment compared to other immigrants last year i began studying for the first time since high school just to realize the field does not interest me i barely even understand the language my gpa is horrible and i cannot change schools for at least another years due to family i cannot even get a job because my town has almost none and the ones it does have are given to the natives i am foreign the welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life i want to live i am also antisocial and seem to fit the symptoms of adhd but my therapist claims it is just anxiety disorder and does not want to prescribe any meds yet i do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue i cannot seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me basically i am unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it is rather depressing

1,i am mad and sad i suffer from depression i have a problem with my family at first i thought i had a problem but more and more i see that it is not me the only problem is everybody else say it is me i have three sisters who are all older than me they try to control every aspect of my life i am years old last june i lost my job and had to move with one of my sisters at first things were fine and then she started to degrade me in front of her friends i tried to ignore her for about months she was verbally abusive to both me and my children i did everything i could to keep the house clean and please her but she always found a reason to dog me out one day we had an argument and i stood up for myself and she was on the phone with a friend while doing so later on that day her friend called me and invited me and my children to stay with her at first i was scared because i did not know her well and i did not know what my sister had already told her about me but i did not want to take my kids to the shelter they had already experience so much so i moved with the friend who is very caring and understanding and my depression was ok for a while i was waiting on a low income apartment and they finally called but meanwhile my mom told me my sisters were upset because none of us has ever depended on anyone outside of the family and i am stupid and betrayed the family but every time i need my family they are never there and if they are they give you lectures and tell everyone your business so i feel alone confused and when i move i do not want to be bothered but i do not have any friends and i do not want to isolate myself because it is unhealthy am i wrong to not want to be bothered or is this a classic case of me being selfish and not wanting to hear the truth from my family below i will give a brief history someone please help been on my own since age never been without work love my children with all my heart was in a great relationship but family did not like him so you know what happened and never got into any family politics always accepted all for who they were and finally when diagnosed with depression at age everyone i know told me i am depressed because i want to be and i could change if i chose to what should i do

0,in this process of letting go i am finding that the most courageous act i can to is to also let in change is the only constant in life but it never seems to get any easier to move beyond the attachments of my heart and head i find that sharing my stories is a part of my process of healing it provides release but also accountability in a way this log is a letter to my future self a reminder a chronicalling taylor and i have broken up more times in the past years than i can even begin to count and in recent years those endings have been becoming more and more final as we sought other loves and different paths but we always seemed to find our way back to each other again this time there is a sense of finality despite our best efforts we just cannot seem to move beyond our struggles it is heartbreaking to think of leaving behind my best friend and all of the dreams we shared for our future but it is also exciting to think of the possibilities life has in store for us i take solace in the small things puddle jumping on my way to the corner market this morning birds enjoying all of their new baths after the rains last night kids in a single file line on their way to a field trip i am seeking new adventures meeting new people exploring new places new things letting in and taking in the world with a new perspective a lightness an openess the past years have brought a lot of loss and lessons i have had to mourn my grandparents for the second time as the dome was sold i had to let go of taylor to be with mark who brought a lot of joy but even more heartache and then regret that i had hurt taylor to pursue such a fruitless endeavor i have always tried to follow my heart at any given moment and sometimes the choices that follow are painstakingly difficult i cannot help but feel that some of those choices have contributed to these insurmountable trials between taylor and i he moved on long ago and now i must begin to i have learned so much in the last few years about love and life and mostly about myself i live my life with the faith that everything happens just as it is meant to i must trust the unfolding let go and let in

0,friend leads much better life i feel resentful we both just graduated she had so many job offers i had none save for an internship i found a job later but i make less than half of what she makes she got a job offer from another firm and referred me to them when she turned them down but i did not get it even though the interview went great and because she makes so much more than i do she is always trying to get me to travel which i cannot afford since i am saving up for grad school she is also currently in a relationship and has tried to set me up with people but it never works she is a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate i am begining to become resentful and envious and i do not want to be a toxic person to be around it is getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while i have nothing to compare how shitty of a person would i be if i distanced myself from her for my own mental wellbeing
1,alone been so long since actually made me feel okay been so long since someone has genuinely made me laugh i get more high strung anxious and depressed every day and everyone around me reminds me all the time living is becoming a chore
0,this is a place that we can talk about the babies in our lives that are our best friends our fur babies the ones we depend on the brighten our lives the ones who depend on us for their own exsistence
1,even if someone says something nice to me i cannot bring myself to believe it was genuine i cannot wrap my head around the idea of someone actually believing anything positive about me to me they must be doing it out of pity depression is like a filter any incoming stimulus is just turned into something negative
1,sigh sometimes i just want to fall asleep peacefully to my music and never wake up sometimes i just want someone to talk to and get my mind off things i complain too much and i feel like a burden to them there is only one person who understands but he will forget me once that happens ill be back to living my pathetic life again
0,i think i first heard about blogs about a year ago i am sure at the time i swore i would never have one now here i am a suggestion from a good friend and i steped right up me and myself might have something to say about what i have done a year ago things were simpler i had no idea what i was in store for getting laidoff going back to school losing people i never thought i would see walk away on the other hand i guess i did not think i would get to see my parents again for the first time in years i probably have more mixed feelings about that than anything but i will save that for another post so here i am somehow the world feels smaller every year i feel like the boundaries society places on our minds through work and school has shrunk my mind and locked it up i did not feel this way a year ago as if every year this world pushes us all one step closer to accepting the bull shit as normal i am not normal now i am a blogger
0,this is my first post of what will hopefully be many i was contemplating writing a blog for about weeks but i fiqured i have not got anything to lose i plan on writing about anything that is of interest to me and somethings that do not this blogs really just for me to keep a record of anything interesting but its free to read by others so if your here now you might as well read on generally i will be going on about websites if checked out music i have heard games i have played and some nonspecific bullshit there is not much else to say on the subject
1,i am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things i do not understand about the world my problem is i think too much and i wish i was off in space thinking about a night out in the city but i am not instead i focus on every negative thing i can i would never kill myself and because i would not do that i really want to know how i can get over all this shit and be happy with what i got i do not know if it is my mind playing the victim but i feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me for example i am and i do not have a car i can understand i should already have it like two years ago but this a prime point for my parents to pick on me for some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tears because she told me i am hopeless and so are all my brothers and that i am an embarrassment this is all because i do not have a car she is usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff am i going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car is it worth hurting your daughter over then there is my supposed boyfriend who picks on me about my weight i am not as thin as i once was i have put on about kilos in years i know it is not a good thing but for ages everything was about my weight i used to weigh kg which is tiny and now i am my boyfriend is at university and thinks that my life holds no meaning because i apparently have no hobbies and i just turn up to my little job i have friends that are completely selfish and i always end up paying for everything and they cannot even do me a simple favor i do not want to play the victim because i have been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it is nothing i would aspire to be i could write pages and pages and pages of how annoyed i am but i thought i would just give an idea i am sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain does anyone know what to do to not feel bad about who you are
0,i am just tired of being in this constant state of flux nothing is ever enough and nothing is ever right i want it all and i want it to be better than the last time i do not really know why i am doing this but i suppose i just need to start opening up my life i need to be ready for the next step no matter what that is i feel so trite how did happiness and enough ever become a bad thing when did i become conditioned to want and feel that want become need again it almost hurts that i am so transparent yet i say nothing ironic i guess that transparent is the wrong word more like childish silly and empty nothing new to say nothing new to share just raw
1,i think i am okay but in reality and in hindsight i am completely not okay i think i am literally dying day by day hello to anyone out there i am just a good guy who did not come from much and i am trying my best to live a fulfilling life but i do not think i can anymore because of this illness i use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun i remember when i use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away it was so much fun then and i felt like i was genuinely pretty happy now a days i feel like i am just literally dead i do not do anything i cannot sleep i hardly eat because i cannot find the motivation to go out and get food and over the past years i have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically it sucks so bad that i genuinely think i will probably die prematurely and die lonely i have no friends no acquaintances and just family that do not understand anything about what i am going through to be honest i wish i was never born i wish i did not exist because facing the world is killing me just the other day i thought about all the opportunities i have missed out on because of my depression like internships jobs career fairs fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that is not going to happen because i am as dead as a rock i turned a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday not even family at this point i am looking at my future and its looking dim i have simply lost the meaning of living i have no self esteem no confidence nothing maybe people like me do not deserve to live a good life perhaps we ought to die and just get over it if there was someone who can tell me my fate i will want to listen to it now i just cannot anymore i fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that i only have one life i am hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest i might as well have a heart attack and just die i hate this i am lonely i am always sad and i am just a piece of shit that is worthless good bye everyone i hope you have all had an awesome day as for me everyday is the same and if things do not change soon i think i will rather end it not even graduating college meant anything for me i fucking hate myself
0,so there is this life i am living and only some know about parts of it and i cannot really write yet about any of it every time i find somewhere i think i am comfortable writing someone steps in and takes that feeling away swiftly and murderously i like to write it is obvious i have been doing it for years but i like to write what i want about whatever i want and it is hard to do so while striving for anynomity i hate having to hide behind a mask of unrecognizable features just to tell the story of my life the true story of my life no frills no strings attached the real deal but there some who whod most definitely not approve and though i cannot blame her for getting upset at the things i do and think about i cannot help it it is just how i am it is the life i live and i am still not being very specific do you know that if she were to read this she would hound me until the years end asking what i am talking about what things in my life i do but cannot write about what would upset her blah blah and we all know how that goes surely so instead i find another spot and take my time trying to find comfort in that spot with intent to eventually just write everything i tire of taking out a pen and notebook jotting everything down while knowing i am the only one who gets to read it i am a bit conceited selfcentered maybe when i say i want others to hear my story too that is what these sites are all about though writing as a sort of entertainment towards others that is just what we all like to do so with that all said give me a few more entries where no one specifically is asking me anything and i will start writing about the real thing until then please bare with my rambling

1,still recovering from exgirlfriend to preface this sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already this is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship a little over a year ago my ex and i finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse it was mainly her abusing me at first getting angry for not texting her quickly enough coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight i assume was because she stayed home all the time and so on the last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating which i never did later to find out she was the one cheating on me i was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that i went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more after the breakup i ended up getting sick and after a couple months even bring myself to take care of myself small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before was the hardest part of my day i know that seems small but it plays into how i feel now months after the breakup i started talking to a friend i met through my ex however they were not and still friends anymore and been happily together for almost a year now there was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous unfortunately i have to see her in may for my prom they are in the same senior class and i an currently a college sophomore i still feel as though i am in a rough place and physically look as good as i should stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that i still struggle with makes me feel like i have been doing worse than her which i know matter but it still bothers me tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then i lose track again i guess my overall issue is i compare myself how i was when with her to where i am now mostly with my appearance also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now my only real win is that nearly kicked my drug addiction mainly weed i was using it to runaway from my problems but now i seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober distanced myself from friends and i simply feel lost and useless to the world in college i make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing i could go back and start over so i could be healthier than i am now looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation thank you to anyone who reads this and responds

1,driving back home from dropping my cousins off i began to think about my future actions i am fully committed to this i know that when i start there is no going back if i do not succeed if this becomes a botched suicide attempt there really will be no life after that my parents will hate me my friends will leave me or treat me with kid gloves either way i suffer even more than i suffer now it does not seem possible that my suffering can grow but i know that if i do not continue or succeed it will i honest to goodness do not know what is wrong with me i mean why do i have to feel like this nothing i have done to make things right with myself has helped things just keep getting worse for me before i let it go because i understood that the bad needs to happen before the good that you have to have the bad with the good i kept on waiting for the good i did not expect sunshine and rainbows but i expected some sort of light even a tiny bit i expected a slight reprieve from the evil dark thoughts swirling in my mind no everything just seemed to worsen with time with me they say that time heals all wounds but time has just worsened mine

1,it is hard to keep standing up keep fighting and get down each time i just want it to end done hard work pay off ever since i was i felt depressed and like not good enough i felt like it was my own fault that i felt so sad and angry and that i good enough for other people one day i decided that if it my own fault i felt that way then i could also improve my situation al my negative emotions went into working hard i finished my studies not by working hard but because i was good at it and put all negative emotions into working out i got accepted into a difficult job at the army now i quit the army because of an injury in my knees at the same time i lost a girl even though we only went on one date i thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the army and all the hard work i put in to get into the army so my situation now jobless girls still despise me have a degree with which i find a job with and all the work i put into improving my situation was for nothing while trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the army i still had periods where i felt very down it just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time the negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible i had the power once to get up and try to fight now i even have the power to suicide but i just wish it was all over eventhough it feels useless i might go to a psychologist how has it helped you guys i to end it all but i want to end it all i know i feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time
1,as my guidance counselor has pointed out to me depression is anger and hatred turned inward now aside from the clich i will try to answer your question i suppose i have been hating myself since first grade the earliest i remember when i wrote that i hated myself in my school folder currently i am and i have been in therapy with a psychologist for a year and months now and currently am not taking any medications i am not sure if my depression causes my self esteem issues but i feel it is more likely in my case that my self esteem issues help fuel my depression as far as your question about treatment i cannot speak for medication seeing as how i have never experienced it but i have had a very very positive therapy experience being able to connect with someone and learn to trust has made me feel valuable and important in life i highly recommend if you are comfortable of course trying cognitive therapy it may feel impossible and overwhelming at first and it can be difficult to find a good match in a therapist but once you do and are able to really work with them it is all worth it
1,i wish i could disappear and leave it all behind i have been constantly thinking of jumping in my car and just drive away from all my problems since new years is it a crazy idea i do not think anyone would miss me
1,the when near people i love anybody that shows a moderate amount of affection towards me i always try to bring them up life sucks for all of us i just want to make people happy always been pretty good at telling jokes which is weird since super introverted and if not joking super quiet the problem is that no one knows when telling the truth try to come out to people try to tell them about my drug abuse try to tell them about who i am nobody wants to listen everyone assumes that the funny guy is just fine nobody wants to have a genuine conversation because sometimes a real fucking downer so yeah my rant

0,breastfeeding lump going for a mammography on monday maybe hi all i really hope i will be able to get out of this sub within a week or so but now that i am in the middle of the waiting stage i feel the need to share with people who get it i am mom of a month old boy and we are looking to try for kid which is why i finally figured i had to see my gp i have had a lump in my right breast for a while months at least probably longer but shook it off as breastfeeding weirdness it is growing a little though i do not want to find out it is something when pregnant or preferably never so i went to get the it is nothing from my gp she referred me for a mammography after reading more that seems that be step if you are after but as i am breastfeeding i am not sure it is necessaryvery useful perhaps an ultrasound would make more sense the hospital in my city would have me wait weeks luckily insurance is fine anywhere so now i will be seen on monday within working days instead of weeks lump is cm oval shaped can move does not hurt gp did not feel anything in my armpit still breastfeeding i have had mastitis last year and they did an ultrasound at that time cannot recall which breast that was i do not know of anyone in my family who had breast cancer however i did do a last year and have my raw dna data i do not have the big brca genes test for but i do have at least one bad mutation in the group you can analyse your raw data via other websites and some other mutations that increase risk for ovarian and breast cancer i will be sure to let my doctors know about that i only found out about the because i searched for it specifically after getting the referral obviously my mind is going all sorts of places i am happy i have a funeral insurance thinking of not ever being able to have more kids doom scenarios much i am an information hoarder so i am just trying to accept that part of who i am and go with the flow telling me to stay off google or reddit is not going to help so instead i am trying to learn as much as i can best case i learn a lot of new stuff that might someday help me support others worst case scenario i am already up to scratch on some of the lingo and can go into whatever comes that much more prepared edit not

1,feeling good about helping people does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you are able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you do not know as an example sometime last month i was having a pretty meh day just not feeling the worst ever but not feeling very good either when on my way home i happened to find an iphone sitting on a grate outside the subway station i picked it up and looked around for the owner then after entering the station found a couple of young women searching their bags and i asked if the phone was theirs it was and they said thank you so much and i felt really happy that i had been able to help them like i just kind of decided right then to forget about my problems because i had helped someone like maybe those two would have never found their phone if i had not come along i mean they probably would have but yknow i felt like i had been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good i really like helping people but i usually get upset when i try to help people i actually know personally because well people do not always want help with more personal issues or even with simple issues from people they know well and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated like i will just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem or simply offering some consolation and instead of i do not know actually trying it or telling me patiently why that is not a good idea they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever and i just feel like jeez whatd i do i am trying to help here and i always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it like am i doing a bad thing by trying to be nice i know that is not true i get sometimes people want to figure things out on their own or i guess you do not like my attitude or blablabla but i do not know you cannot maybe acknowledge that i am trying to do good but in a situation where it is just strangers trying to find their way cross the street lost a thing or whatever it is easy to tell when they need help because everythings a lot more straightforward if that makes sense if someone needs help it is usually pretty obvious and they are almost always pretty receptive to help and provided you just look like a normal person they do not judge no biases or baggage over past interactions or whatever they are just happy to have help so yeah i guess this is a little longer than it needs to be but yeah helping random people feels good and distracts from my depression a little is what i was saying anyone else feel this way

0,so i have to be in this wedding in september i am trying to convince my friend peter m to escort me to this wedding but so far he will not commit to it my hubby is going to be out of town on a camping trip so i am going to have to go solo if peter does not go it is a bolivianirish wedding the bride is about and the groom is about plus the groom looks about as irish as irish can get complete with red hair and freckles and the bride looks truly bolivian they are quite an interesting couple to see so the problem is that the only people i will know at the entire wedding are the bride groom and brides mother most of the people on the brides side are from bolivia and speak very little english i know that this sounds like a very fun event but if peter m was the good friend that he says he is he would come and escort me oh here is the interesting thing the groom has multiple piercings including his penis and testicles i am all okay with the piercing thing and everything but i cannot help but thinking the dingaling piercing has got to hurt oh and he did them all himself i asked the bride to be if urine and other bodily fluids leak out the other holes and she confirmed that they did dude that means his dick is like a freaking colander that is a bit strange to me i would be afraid to have sex with him not that i would want to anyway for fear that some parts of his penis rings would come off inside of me and then have to be located okay that would be just too creepy okay enough rambling about nothing anyway my daughter is crying and my husband is ignoring her

0,lump nipple discharge already had ultrasound amp nervous hello all i had a sort of red mark on my breast a few days ago and a lump i decided i should get it checked out particularly since had some nipple discharge yellow brownish and some weird changes in my period and a family history plus some risk factors my doctor swabbed the fluid and ordered an ultrasound which now had not fluid filled like a cyst or abscess but the radiologist said he thought that although there was heterogeneity in the lump he still thought it was most likely a fibroadenoma but that i need to follow up with a clinician who deals specifically with and bumps ultimately i was told to wait for the formal report tuesday i missed a call a few hours after the ultrasound from my primary care doctor assuming in my nervous mind that the swab bacterial and instead was for cytology and she has the results left voicemail asking that i call the office but it was too late to call back just still nervous despite the comment anyone have a similar experience

1,i have always felt different i guess i am a little weird loner gay but at the same time smart loving people admire me and respect me i felt depression back in tried different medications until effexor worked for me then i felt good for several years now depression has come back again and with much vengeance it took my soul and mind i am back with my partner after a short break up which i think caused the monster to come back i lost motivation in life and i called my ex to come back into my life since i was feeling suicidal he claims he loves and will be there for me and he has been a great deal of support for me i am taking cymbalta for weeks now but my doctor says it will take more weeks until we decide which medication i should stay with in the meantime there are suicidal thoughts running in my head as well as some of hope i would hate to miss out on my sons high school graduation or my own graduation from the rn program as a nurse i know that there is hope but no matter how much knowledge you have you will always feel lost and helpless when depression is in your body my message is that we should be patient and continue to do positive things because at the end all this mess in our heads will only seem like a period of time where we were sleeping or we blanked out i am hurting so much and i know there are many more hurting out there but let us be kind to ourselves and give ourselves words of appreciation and affection over and over take care of yourselves and be patient just like i will be god is there watching over us and will not let us perish unless we want to
0,lifelong friend keeps lashing out so i have this friend she is my best friend and have been forever we have been friends since we were we traveled the world together we are now she is been through a lot difficult family stuff life is not easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling honestly she needs me without me she would be pretty lost and she knows it i pretty much take the mothers role her mother is not there and usually she is more destructive than anything and i do a lot of the stuff mothers do including being her punching bag because of all of this she tends to be very impulsive and when she is upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff and that she wants me and everyone else to fck of and leave her alone sometimes worse it does not sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it is really really hard every time i have to tell her that it hurts me i have to practically beg her to say sorry eventually she breaks down and says she is so sorry and that she cannot control herself i always forgive the thing is i know she does not mean it and also i know she is naturally impulsive but also i do not think she is really trying to control it i know she is got so much on her plate that it is natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything but it is really hard for me even though i know she does not mean it right now i honestly do not feel like i want to talk to her i think the fact i always forgive makes her not really try to control it she lost dozens of friends because of it but she know i will always stay right now i just feel like telling her that it is been one time too much i have warned her before that eventually i might just unwillingly break and that i cannot take it i forgave her probably over a hundred times seriously and i honestly care about her and i honestly know she does not mean it and i honestly worry that without me she will not be able to survive but also i just cannot stand being a punching bag anymore it is emotionally exhausting and i feel drained i do not know what to do anymore i cannot live my life like this but i cannot live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her which really might happen

0,am i a bad friend i do not know what to do recently two friends of mine dating have cut me off entirely without providing a reason let us call them j and k j is an old friend from years back when we were kids and k has been my friend since highschool approx six years its happened before that they have cut me off periodically for no given reason then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media when i ask them to explain they get defensive and say things along the lines of you know what you did even when i try to explain that no i actually do not i have never consciously done anything to hurt them the one thing i thought it could be was that i am friends with a girl they dislike but after recently confronting j its apparently not just that there is a long list of reasons why i am a terrible friend but he does not have time to list them or even name one feeling insecure about this i have confided in other friends who assure me that i am not a bad friend although i have asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch back to k and j they recently went so far as to invite all of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming but made a point to exclude me when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of i am acting like a bitch i have tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends i think for so many years i have tried extending olive branches explaining that i do not know what i have done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologizefix the situation but j responded with passive aggression and k so far has not responded at all quite frankly i do not expect her to bottom line is should i just cut them off entirely its hard since i will be seeing a lot of k this year as we are studying the same course and j is one of my brothers best friends please help
1,does anyone else have this constant dark feeling lingering over them recently my mom died and this dark feeling of hopelessness has been worse than ever before i do not know what to do anymore nothing makes me happy and i do not want to die but i do not want to exist either i can occasionally enjoy things but at the end of the day i just think to myself why am i still doing this everyone keeps telling me that i have to live for myself and not search for answers through others but i feel like i cannot help myself i feel like no one around me understands what i am going through i feel like a robot at work forcing myself to seem okay i just feel like living with this feeling inside of me is so hard and maybe genuinely not even worth it i do not even feel like taking my medicine or eating heathy or anything i just wake up go to work come home and sleep as much as possible sorry to rant on here i am not sure what else to do

0,is it safe hello i am a new user so if this post ends up in a weird placethread pls bear w me has anyone used lately they offer a two week trial but still require your credit card information is this suspicious it does not cost anything for the first two weeks and then you can end the trial so you do not have to pay anything even then but i just feel a little uncomfortable dialing my credit card information on there online am i being too doubtfull share your experiences thank you if my english is not perfect that is because i am not a native speaker
1,i do not want to exist anymore my girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago saying she does not love me anymore but without explaining me why i then tried to ask her out one last time not to come back together just to clarify what happened she does not want to see me and when i write to her she answers back just so that i cannot say she is ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument i really had trusted her and she had done the same until a couple of months ago she is always told me i was the only person who she actually trusted even after we split up so i feel like i have been used and then thrown away like an object i then realized i am not good at all at socializing that she was the only truly important person in my life except for other two friends of mine who have their own lives and whom i do not want to annoy too much with my problems and that i will probably never know anyone else in my life every day i feel like i am bothering other people and i am not doing anything good and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend i do not want to commit suicide but often i find myself thinking how better it would be if i stopped existing

1,i die a little inside with every customer tw let me start by saying i have been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since january i take sertraline every day and it is helped me tremendously i was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in november of last year and it was a huge step forward no education no ged no transportation no job experience except for working for a family company since i was a literal child needless to say i felt like i overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time i have had extreme social anxiety since my early teens so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counterintuitive now i do not know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day but the anxiety has completely faded gone zilch good right well in its place a little seedling sprouted and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head pushes against my skull crushes my organs my spark my will to move forward i hate people so fucking much i am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents i am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor i am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order after it was already prepared because the soda machine was out of cherry fanta what the fuck is wrong with you i go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled spoiled assholes every now and then there is an angel someone who is not a total asshole to me it could be something so small to you but it can make my entire day that much easier perhaps you already know what you want to order and do not hold up a line of ten people because you are picky as fuck perhaps you tip me cents usually it is treating me like i am a feeling thinking human instead of the shit on your heel i bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they are truly appreciated i have come so far and yet i am so close to giving up it is wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if i have a promising future when i do not i pretend that i do not slice my thighs with razors that i am not covered in self harm scars that all is well i pretend i do not fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck i pretend the love of my life and best friend is not homeless and is not living in a tent with a heroin addict i pretend i pretend i pretend i am so tired
1,it is become a personality trait depression has become part of my identity as much as i would like to say it does not define me it really does it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences i know we have one life and that there is nothing after that but that fact is not motivating in many moments like this i am convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive short range unchanging emotions is my proof feels completely pointless and childish to even vent me writing this feels ridiculous

0,fight fight fight hey reddit community i need to know if in the wrong in a certain situation so a friend and i let us just call him kevin have been good friends for years and have always gotten along for the most part pretty well earlier this week though he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours the rumor was completely false and out of left field so much out of left field that i confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing now this mutual friend had told my friend kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal but still jokingly manner but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not it still bugged me though that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else spreading this false rumor and whatnot so i decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor the mutual friend was surprised that i confronted them about it and complained to kevin and thought that it was that i would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me i think funny and i good enough friends with them to actually care but kevin is extremely angry at me and we talked to each other or about it since making me think that things will naturally go south i admit i may have overreacted although i think in the wrong so i refuse to apologize any advice reddit community if i believe that i truly in the wrong should i really apologize for how i handled this

0,dear my bathroom mirror i have been roaming around in the empty street coming home to an empty room talking to an empty wall and afraid filling an empty glass i have been weird these days and more to that i have been turning my face around way too much so much it leads me to this question i really hope you can answer what is movin on dear friend what is it really is it driving twice faster everytime you pass those places that have that memories is it turning the radio off soonest you hear those songs that scream that memories is it turning your car around close to home just because the thought of finding yourself alone in an empty room becomes an unbearable thought is it forcing yourself to be around people as much as you can no matter how it kills your inside and how you feel much emptier in the more crowded places is it burning all the objects that has anything to do with that memories is it asking your boss to give you more assignement so that you can bury yourself in it no matter how tired you are already just so you do not have to think about that memories is it finding yourself in the arms of randoms strangers and finding yourself in the more strange rooms with strange smells among huffings and puffings from these stranger whom language you cannot even understand only to avoid those feelings resemblance to those memories is it not letting your glass run out of vodkas in those bars where you can forget how awkward it is to dance with an empty feelings and then fill your frozen stare with more vodkas so that the most you would care about is not to fall face first is it logging off twice faster than the lightning whenever you see him go online is it saying you are fine thousand times to yourself is it finding yourself putting on more make up than what you used to do just so that you do not look pale is it turning your face around twice as much whenever you see any guys walking with blue checkered shirt and cargo pants is it numbing your feelings is it freezing your inside is it killing who you were before and becomes a whole lot of different person or is it leaving this island what is it dear friend i love myself i deserve better i am moving on i will be okay i have valium now

0,ok i have been wanting to blog for awhile thing is i cannot decide how honest i want to be in it what if someone in the family found it guess i will just have to take that chance so anyway what i really wanted to write about is shana i hate talking to anyone in the family about her because i do not want to upset them i mean what if they are having a good day then i pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again although i know realistically that we will never stop grieving i still cannot believe that she killed herself immediately after that week sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident but come on shana was brilliant she knew how little she was taking a bottle of antidepressants and pain pills was not an accident she wanted to leave she wanted the pain to stop that is why she took them at bedtime i still hear my brother describing how he found her right after we got to the house he told us everything took us up to shanas room and showed us her bed showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried cpr told us the police had to pry her out of his arms told us she was already getting stiff and she was cold he said so cold sometimes i cannot stop hearing the stuff from that week i can hear him crying my name i remember so much from that week picking out the fingernail polish helping grandma iron her clothes previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters we took a picture for reference my sister was so tough i could not see the details through the tears but j did even writing in my journal i feel like i need to edit stuff out but i cannot it is time to get this stuff out shanas been gone for over a year and i still do not really believe it she was only and had so much to live for i will never stop wondering why her suicide note was in her live journal titled enough is enough that is it i am done i love you all the same message or maybe a little longer was set up as an away message in outlook i never could bring myself to email her so i would get it back as a reply i asked my sister if she had made up an album of shana stuff she said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures i do not know though seems like i might do an album but do i put the funeral notice and program in there too i wanted to keep them do not know why

1,my boring sob story family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and i should make the most of being a kid so when depression hit me i thought it was normal but it feel i upset all the time it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling things started to feel odd for me certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong like be toned down somehow eventually i became completely disconnected from my emotions save for the occasional moment when i actually find something funny been on two types of medication and had therapy too neither of which did anything for me i notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything now going to the shop or getting the bus is something rather not do things do every day my social life went backwards as well as my social skills now afraid to talk to people i literally reject girls interested in on the spot before i even have chance to fuck it up myself things that i would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy then came the cynicism belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain suppose true in a sense but i wish i have this everybody with the same mindset hard to believe the same person at times been years now and had enough just do not know what to do i feel like tried everything help but feel partly responsible for buying into the shit i told myself

0,cousin not seen for years trash talking me to my son sorry long post i just need a rant and maybe some advice on what to tell my son my youngest son came home last night and said he was invited to a party this weekend and could he go after all the i gave permission he then proceeded to tell me that the mum of his friend me and that i hate and i found this odd as i particularly hate anyone and certainly not one of his acquaintances mums it turns out that she is a cousin of mine who i seen for years since the death of our grandfather her father accused me of stealing my grandads home and contents not true but i did care for my grandfather at his home that i bought and my grandfather lived rent and bill free for years prior to his death when he passed away my uncle said he wanted things from the home for himself i had no issue with that and when my uncle this dad said he wanted the tv i said he could take the rent book for it too my grandad rented it from a local place my uncle was pissed but accepted that it was rented i also put into boxes all the things my grandad had willed my aunts and uncles for them to take away after the funeral some bear to and i put it in storage for them to take at a later date now lived in my home since then and over the years changed the house to my taste and extended it unbeknownst to myself until last night each time i changed something my uncle has bad mouthed me to other family members and run me down convincing others that i stole the house from them was a rental property when my grandfather moved in and it was myself who purchased it over the years i have noticed that my family are not very communicative with me but put it down to initially my brothers death years after my grandad and then my mums a few years later but after speaking to others in the family last night discovered what has been said about me now i particularly give a damn about said about me but i am upset that my cousin has told my son that i hate her he is autistic and things like this stick in his head last night i just said something like know the lady how can i hate her and is that something you think i would to which he agreed that it something saydo my problem is the party the parents are going to be there one of the reasons allowing him to go and concerned that they will trash talk me to him and how do i explain to him that some people just believe what they want regardless of what the truth is i want to give him all this information before he goes as not really a problem unless my cousin makes it one of you see what i mean thank you if you made it this far and any advice would be appreciated

0,today was teddy bear day at alexanders daycare all of the kids in his class were supposed to bring teddy bears yesterday they made teddy bear books out of construction paper you get the picture alexander does not like to get boxed in to conventional thinking so he interpreted it as pet day this opened up his entire stuffed animal collection to be taken to school alexander chose his big bird to take to school but it is no ordinary stuffed big bird oh no this one was given to him as paybacks for some annoying toy that my wife or i gave to someone elses child this big bird has a whole bunch of games that you can choose by squeezing his toes he also has a backpack full of blocks that have letters numbers and shapes you put a block into his hand and talks about it depending on which game you picked sounds good on paper right the catch is that some deviant toy maker endowed this big bird with the most annoying nasal voice and it has no off switch that is right once you awaken the bird it starts talking trying to get the child to play it waits a few seconds and then tries again and again and again remember how i said that there is no off switch yeah i imagine that the designers of this toy are in a witness protection program somewhere think about how this toy got made in some corporate meeting room an assortment of marketing technical sales and other people got together probably many times reviewed this design and decided that it was a good idea anyway this is what alexander took to school i thought that i had hidden it better than that but i was mistaken anyway when i took him into his room his teacher thought that the bird was cute and then he awakened it i chose that moment to beat feet out of there in the evening when i returned to pick up alexander his bird was not in his cubby with his blanket and other things it was on top of the cabinets as far out of reach as the teachers could make it they must not like that voice either

0,clingy friend so i have a friend who lives pretty far from me let me preface this by saying that he has expressed a romantic interest in me but i am not interested in men and have told him so he helped me through a difficult time in my life and i have thanked him many times for it i have tried to do the same for him on multiple occasions but it seems like the more attention i give him the more he wants i do not feel that we need to have hour long phone discussions and text messages on a daily basis i talk to anyone that much i started ignoring a text or two here and there hoping he would catch on he did apparently and we just went about weeks with no contact had he sent me a normal text today i would have answered instead he sent a passiveaggressive since feeling better you never bother to call me this is simply not true i have called him many times when he said he needed to talk even though i hate talking on the phone i just simply take this level of neediness not sure how to explain to him that constant contact drives me nuts and i need space every time i try to explain this to him he seems to feel that it was designed as a personal attack against him any thoughts on this not going to text him back until had some time to think about the right thing to say
0,today my mother tried to commit suicide due to recent family events it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment inadequacy and loneliness in my mom she felt alone luckily she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm she chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes the exhaust fumes made her tired and in her tired stupor she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death she had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup i thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead her attempt was unsuccessful originally i blamed myself for having been hard on her i have always been honest with my mother and she has always kept a strong face but today i learned how fragile she truly is i take it upon myself to protect her and support her no matter what she raised me and continues to raise my younger siblings time that we give back i have been thankful that i have not suffered the loss of someone i love to suicide i thought that i would see the signs if it were going to happen i i will be more aware and i will show my love for people i care about i often think about the ones i love but take the time to reach out that changes today i refuse to hold back my love for fear of being hurt and pushed away for the people i love are not hearing it enough but still stay i am grateful for the second chance with my mother i have thought often about missing her someday when she dies i never thought that it might come so soon i am renewed and reborn my goals and ambitions stronger than ever my love for my family renewed in the wake of our war my mother the warrior on the front lines taking the shots from sibling to sibling and softening the blow so we all can continue the crusade this will change today i choose to love

0,a long story so the situation i was and still sort of am in a group of four friends friends for about years one of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago but a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new best friend it did not go well and suddenly the ng stopped hanging out with our group we hangout but mostly play games online but what i learn till the following week was that she hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back they lied about having things to do or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together when we did hangout the other two and i they both acted odd and withdrawn i attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to ng but i got backlash for doing so so i let up however later i learned about her not wantingbeing to hangout with me was a where the three of them sat me down and told me that bf old her that she be friends with me anymore because her bf told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her bf in addition i learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week they had lied to me about the whole situation they knew about the ultimatum that bf gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now they claim it was to save my feelings but it come off that way the ended with her leaving and me leaving as well the next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided i am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with ng and ignore me for the most part so i confront my two friends one been friends with for five years and the other three i tell them unfair that i am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group i also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that ng is the victim because she lost a friend so did i they have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but i told them that i feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me they tell that they will always be friends with her and that i ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision so i told them that i have too walk away from the group then because i feel valued respected or able to trust them after what they have done am i in the wrong what should i do should i walk away i want to throw away my two closest friends but i feel like they even care about me anymore i apologize for the long post

1,i am new to these boards and i hope i am posting in the right spot i have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since i have a host of chronic painful autoimmune related diseases i am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery takes a year to recover from this surgery this family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed fed and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would it is a daunting task for me under the circumstances insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help hence i am managing all of it alone once in a blue moon my inlaws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that i ask for help my house is cluttered i saw that topic and i am not sure if its because i am so depressed or because i have been sick too much to take care of it i think perhaps its both i know that at least some of my depression is situational but i also know that some of it is not i am on medication but the medicines have never done a whole lot for me i have tried them all i was found to be resistant to medication whatever that means i was hospitalized for a month period in the for suicide attempts i guess what brought me here is that i feel like i am about to crack and am trying to find a way to avoid that i am hoping to get past this pain caused by this disease i have so that i can get the energy back that i need to unclutter my house have a genuine smile on my face when handling my nursing duties and get a hold on my life in general

0,my wifes car money and my brother what do i do my wife and i got married but instead of an engagement ring we decided i would buy her a car instead i brought the toyota and moved in she already owned another honda this way we would have eventually she gave her honda to her brother who was also in need and i told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the honda anyway not her so he has every right to own that honda especially since we had at the time keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision not hers to let him have the car because although i am married to her and her dad bought her the car i felt like since her dad bought it he has the right to it and since her brother is her dads male descendant he has the right to the car sorry we are an asian family so now we have toyota the engagement ring car with a baby on the way we decided we would lease another nissan ourselves so we could have cars again recently my brother was involved the caribbean island hurricanes where he goes to med school and his whole semester was shifted back to america until either this august or december so now he is also in need of a car for about months i told my wife that since we are leasing a nissan we can let my brother borrow our current toyota for the time being my wife does not want to give up the toyota to him in fear that she will lose it i thought this was unjustified because she gave her honda to her brother so why cannot i let my brother borrow the toyota too both of us grew up believing in helping a person in need and i feel like i went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers but she did not let me do the same when it came to my brother but then again i feel like she does have a right to the toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time after her brother took the honda we have been using car for the last year i figured we could keep using car for another months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car am i wrong here is she technically right am i unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wifes decision since it was a replacement for her ring
1,wonder how the world would be if they have i heard this lyric and it sticks with me fuck
0,it is hard for me to say it that is what he said to me darn what have i done i should not bring up the matters but this stupid mouth just slip it out he sacrifice it for the sake of my relationship though i do not know what is in his mind exactly i am going to miss him big time i do not know whether he really wants it or just play a around gosh can i lie to myself i am so tired being here suppressed by all my childish fear and if you have to leave i wish that you cud just leave because your presence still lingers here and it will not leave me alone these wounds will not seem to heal this pain is just too real there is just so much that time cannot erase when you would cried i would wipe away all of your tears when you would scream i would fight away all your fears i have held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me you used to captivate me by your resonating light but now i am bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me i have tried so hard to tell myself that you are gone and though you are still with me i have been alone all along
1,i take it that by you saying learn to give rather than take and you will find life turns around that you are implying that i am a taker and not a giver and maybe that is so maybe all the blood that i have donated it gives me a sense of purpose and sometimes it seems that the nurses there are the only ones who care that i am alive and that is only because of what my body produces or the times when i do things out of the kindness of my heart rather than for monetary gains or as a means to earn someones favor or to make them somehow indebted to me like others would do maybe doing all that still means that i am a taker i do not know i have been told that my perceptions cannot really be trusted but that does not sound like someone who is a taker to me i am and by that age most guys have been in at least one relationship i have not that is why i have set the timeframe everyone i know has had at least a taste of love and human companionship by the time they were so i have decided that if no one wants me why stay living alone means seeing what i want on tv and having absolutely no one to enjoy or discuss it with that is my view of it pessimistic yes but it is been the truth for me i am sorry to sound bitter but this is exactly what i face out in the world people see my problems and think that it is my fault i hoped i would get a different attitude here

0,hi there i do not plan on telling anyone i know about this blog spot fuck it i have been on an eating binge since friday on friday i ate mushrooms and had an awesome time hanging out with some people i am just getting to know it does seem however that i am not going to be hooking up with one of the girls like i had hoped which makes about times in a row for me to fall into that gray area called the friend with no benefits zone i am going to be a dick from now on not that i feel like a dick but i do not want to be disappointed by some shitty friendship where i get to hear some girl cry about her exotic exboy friend fuck him that pillow biter fuck her i cover the tabs and she knows why once a month she might pretend she wants me over after he neglects to call her because he is getting it some where else and god forbid i summon the courage to bust a move even on an eight of strong mushrooms i cannot put aside my cowardice and at least offend someone with my rotten cigarette breath kisses i had gum my trip lasted way longer than everyone else and she clearly did not want me to even sleep on her couch but i could not just up and drive home i was seeing of everything and they were all melting i did feel bad wandering around the tiny apartment zapped out of my mind while she slept i did bug out at the beginning of the night there were about minutes to an hour where i could not bring myself to say one word i think everyone else was starting to think that either i was retarded angry with them or even more retarded lucky i did break out with some good material and get some good laughs so did my friends cousin she also had some funny moments i keep sending weird text messages this girl i even called her and left a message with the excuse that i could not find my wallet just so she would call me back and tell me it was not at her apartment but to most people this probably is not a new trick what is wrong with me why do not girls like me fuck friendships i will never again establish another plutonic friendship with a lady i do not care who beats her

0,in the year was my greatest regret ever the only peson invoved and to be blamed is me it was my fault that i did not i did not do well in my p s l e i was studying in coral primary school there is where my problems started firstly i mixed around in the wrong group i was new in coral primary as i had just transfered from loyang primary in the second month of in the beginning i thought it would be ok and the things i did were fun and i enjoyed it very much i skipped the remedials i had every day to meet my friends in the car park there i would spend hours to play with fire but i did not smoke i did not pick up any bad habbits as i already knew they were to harm me and when i went home i would tell my mum that i went for my remedials i thought i would concentrate in my work as well as well as go out with my friends but this did not happen instead i started avoiding studies soon i started getting involved in more trouble and later on i started thinking that my friends were more important than my studies when the time came that was two years later in the year i wasent ready it was my p s l e it was now that i realised that my mistakes during my exams i went blank in my weakest subject maths the rest of the subjects were average i started to panic as i knew i was going to get bad marks in the end i did i did very badly and got into a school i did not wnted siglap secondary at first i thought that i would do anything to get out but as time passed i became to know the school beter and realised it was a good place to learn in but every where there will be this and that has there is no scholl that is perfect well i was confused in what to do i was lost but i knew that i had to adapt to it and strive to do my best i was angry and dissapointed at myself on my mistake but i knew i had to let the past be the past but not forget the past but learn from the mistakes i learnt my mistakes and i know that i should not do it again now i have stuck this in my head that i should not mix around in the wrong company as the consequences would be unbearable and that i should pay attension in my studies now that i know the good and the bad and now i believe i can achieve my goal

0,sometimes i have a crazy notion that runs through my head it has actually more like a recurring question that puzzles me at odd times and places but usually when i see some otherwise taken for granted ingenious invention for example it happened this past sunday as i sat in an emergency room waiting area a friend had been bitten by a dog as i watched the automatic sliding glass doors what a wonderful and convenient invention a sensor detects your presence and opens the door then it hit me what would benjamin franklin think of that i think of ben and what he would think quite often when i hear the telephone ring see airplanes in the sky or cars on the road just the idea of electricity that covers lights the radio television motion pictures the list is endless the concept of the internal combustion engine the physics of flight just think of how much fun it would be to tool around with ben showing him all the things we have manage to create can you imagine explaining how man has walked on the moon how would he react to hearing that we have a satellite circling capturing data recording it and reporting back to earth from the planet saturn we have come so far and have so much ben would be very impressed with everything that has usually when another of my recurring thoughts hits me he would be impressed with all the gadgets and inventions but eventually he would see what kind of society we have become he would be appalled by our lack of education in light of all the technological marvels sure it took a smart person somewhere to figure out the concepts of the new technology but look what we have given up in return for all our efforts we have people that cannot read and write people that do not have or use their imaginations people that cannot think for themselves people that are happiest doing no more than mindlessly doing nothing our great society has become stupid ill mannered uncaring and lazy it has a shame really and i am certain that ben would not like it
1,no friends whatsoever living in isolation please help me i am in my final semester of undergrad i am i live in a university apartment i have severe social anxiety i have gone through therapy before stopped for a while and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance every day is almost total isolation i go to class i fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do i go back to my apartment my randomly assigned roommates all several years younger than me keep to themselves i am too afraid to talk to them so i hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework day in day out rinse repeat this has been my life for several years now i am incredibly insecure i have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder i am probably quite good looking but i have never been in a relationship i am still a kissless virgin this eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women another reason to isolate further i am losing touch with reality i have loving parents but their advice is not particularly helpful what i want is a friend someone to talk tobut the anxiety gets in the way i can talk to people in a structured setting like therapy or online and easily and freely at that but it is the act of doing it in the real world in a natural setting that is just impossible i fantasize a lot about killing myself though i do not think i could ever actually carry it out if someone could just be there for me i would feel better but i have given up almost all hope

1,hi there my name is tim i am years old and live in the uk i have been prescribed of paroxetine but stopped taking it a couple of months ago as it was not helping me in my situation which has probably made me physically worse my depression probably stems from low self esteem and the feeling of general failure i have suffered for years now not constantly as success at work can suppress it i e times when i feel i am contributing something to the outside world i probably appear relatively normal i have to stop now as i need to go out i will try and articulate where i am coming from later
0,hell i will come up with something to say sooner or later probably later
0,this is beyond messed up for me to think but i kind of just need to vent i got a phone call this morning that my great uncle died last night i cannot stand this man to begin with an addict a liar a thief abuser manipulator convicted felon multiple times he was attempting to run from the cops and he hit a telephone pole and he died i am assuming he was dui or picking up drugs not one bit surprised in fact surprised he lived this long he was given every resource and opportunity in the world and he fucked every single one of them up for the past years he was one of those people who were better off just in jail so they do harm to themselves others and the community i cringed every time i saw him around i understand for the life of me why people put up with his shit and enable him the same people who put up with him were the same ones who would complain and complain about him my mom want my younger siblings around him we put it past him to do stuff to kids i was so sick of hearing what kenny did or tried to do i feel absolutely horrible for my great grandfather who is and is always the one to clean up his mess i feel bad for my great grandfather in the sense he has to burry his son and once again clean up the mess that he has left i may be the only person to not see this as a no one has to sit around and worry watch their things wait around for a phone call that either dead or in jail again all of the bullshit just stops

1,i miss the days where i at least had depression sleep to look forward to more of a vent here so bare with me i have not had a good night of undisturbed deep sleep where i wake up feeling refreshed in years like i kind of autopilot through my day trying to ignore how nothing really excites or motivates me and that i have stopped progressing towards any dreams or goals and the more i am awake the longer i have to struggle with that and i do not even have sleep to look forward to i used to be able to sleep through anything and for many hours at a time it was awesome idk just like i am riding a vicious cycle of depression worsening sleep sleep worsening depression slowly downwards to the point where i think not existing would finally feel like the best damn rest i ever had anyway thanks for reading and stuff felt good to vent a little
1,am i crazy for wanting to get back with her so let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first april we met at work became really good friends she still had a boyfriend but broke up with him about weeks after we started hanging out june i told her i liked her as more than a friend she did not feel this way towards me at the time july she started dating a guy she already knew we will call him jake august she broke up with jake jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him septembe she told me she is always been attracted to me but was not ready for a relationship i was in love with her at this time after knowing her for a while and her being everything i want in someone suggested being fwb which i took her up on but whenever i tried to make a move on it she did not seem to want to do anything we hung out just us every day would always be talking but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything mid october she said how we would be better off being friends since we did not seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem and that she started talking to jake again she is currently still dating jake but from what i hear from her are on the verge of another breakup and now i want her more than ever i was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me and i am still not over her and she knows this if she cuts things off with jake i do not know what to do i want her back more than anything but at the same time it is like she put me through such pain and i do not want to chance that happening again she is everything that i could possibly want in a girl and i cannot imagine myself without her and we are still friends which probably is not helping to be honest but she is still my best friend am i crazy for feeling this way

0,leapfrogge steale poacher etc just for some context in my form group like a morning register class or a house class as some call it i sat at a table with people i did not really talk to but since i could not change seats i decided to make some friends with people at the table in gradeyear or i met two guys who are now great friends of mine one i talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues fast forward a few months and you have the situation above so i started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name manny now manny and i only talked in form and after i would go back to my main social circle with my best mate after a while about grade maybe i decided manny should go and chat with me and my best mates social circle for once so introduced them both to each other and they got on well now between year i definitely noticed that manny started taking more of my best mates interest which makes sense and happens often so i did not think of it it only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home instead he would invite manny and manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot over time i would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something they would say i am not sure if i can go only for me to find out they went with manny somewhere sure we are all still friends but i feel like i am being slowly excluded is this just me what do you all think
0,loneliness dominates you you can hide it well but it is there and your friends can see it you constantly feel alone and need to do things to fill your time you are afraid to tell people this but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way and you think you screwed up everything and when you are in love is when you are sad the most urllink what emotion dominates you brought to you by urllink quizilla she came over today i realized i missed spending afternoons with her i guess its because i lost her for a while maybe i needed that i have a motto paranoid bitches should go to hell because when you are too many things go on in your mind unnecessary stuff i am one of those bitches i have been ignored i am being paranoid about it its time to go to hell

1,depressed people get sick too how stigma in the medical community made me sicker often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression when i say sick they are too quick to assume the depression is the because of my pain and not the other way around after five minutes listening to me breathe looking into my throat and and touching the outside of my neck they are stumped so it must be mental illness it got the the point that when i was having severe abdominal pain i go to the hospital i had to push for any kind of testing which took forever when i finally found a doctor who listened to me she told me i should have gone to the er then i was depressed about that i had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity turns out been pretty sick and needed surgery nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic painful illness with no cure bittersweet solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure but still struggling a lot i just found out that i may be infertile after my doctor said having a baby could help my condition so that was depressing too i think my depression caused my infertility checkmate doctors i did start seeing a psychiatrist and he is a kind man he diagnosed me with depression and anxiety he has never suggested that my depression is the because of my physical problems and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient given me depression medication but i know how much helping chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and just depressing always had depression but this just makes it worse he has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand people with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily it took me years and years to get anywhere a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness to getting through today friends

0,friendship over wedding i am not sure if it is appropriate to end a friendship because i invited to a wedding but everyone else in the group of friends were and i even know about it she did not even bother telling me this was a very special friend to me and i would tell her everything about me back in college and she was the most important person to me i tried keeping in contact after she graduated by texting her at least once a month etc but she would hardly ever respond it seemed as if i was making much more of an effort than she was when i found out that i invited but everyone else in our group was she hurt me in a way so deeply that she could never understand she did tell me that i was on her list of people she wanted etc when i found out because she was that important to me i eat sleep or study for my liscening boards for over a week i lost seven pounds over one week i called my psychologist a couple of times cried endlessly and it really hurt to know that maybe we as close as we once were i am not sure if you can understand how i really felt not even sure if appropriate to place it in a thread like this not sure if it was appropriate for me to end a friendship due to this situation and is it true that if person a does not invite person b to the wedding and if person b got hurt by it that person a has to accept the result of person b wants to end the friendship
1,i think i am having a nervous breakdown i have struggled off and on for about years with anxiety and depression the latter half has been mostly on recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from zoloft to effexor because the zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less i do not think the effexor is having a very good effect on me my depression has been worse than ever on top of that i found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely will not live more than months she is only and she has been my entire world since i adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times because of these things my moods have been very bad and i had to leave work a few days ago and i have not been back since and i am pretty sure they are going to fire me because i am still new although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime every single day i do not have much of a support system my mom is pissed at me about work and i am living with my grandfather who just does not get it i do not really have much in the way of friends which is i guess why i am ranting on reddit looking for some kind of support i do not really know what to do i am going to call my psychiatrist monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off effexor i want to find a job that is less intense than this one and less hours hopefully part time i do not know i just need some supportadviceanything

0,my friend is ruining her frienships i am not really sure what to do here my best friend let us call her sam has lost a lot of friendships recently and i mean a lot in the past two years she is lost almost every close friendship she is ever had the count is in the double digits something would happen and she would declare them dead to her and never speak to them again unfortunately i find myself usually feeling like it is sams fault that the friendships are crumbling recently she is started shamelessly using her friends one girl worked as a seamstress at a community theater in her free time and sam would constantly arrive unannounced and drop off clothes she wanted tailored imposing absurd timeline even saying she would be back that night to pick the dresses up when her friend finally asked sam to start paying sam announced to everyone that their friendship was over and that she refused to associate with someone who did not view her as a friend she is started yelling at people for not texting her more she called one of her now former friends an elementary school teacher and yelled at her for not responding to her texts about where they were going to get dinner that night she wanted to make sure she did not eat the same type of food for lunch the teacher cancelled and they have not spoken since and unfortunately with each new friend lost her demands on those remaining have become more and more extreme her need for attention has gotten out of hand she demands that we all hang out four nights a week and constantly accuses people of not valuing her friendship enough if they cannot make it one friend spent every night with her one week trying to show sam that she mattered when the friend did not continue that schedule the next week sam screamed at them for pulling away and called her a coward for not just ending it if she did not want to be friends worst of all she accuses people of saying things they have never said claiming that she is stupid she can read between the lines and when people try to explain that they never intended to hurt or upset her she claims that it does not matter what they said what matters is how she was made to feel it should not come as a surprise that sam has serious selfesteem issues she is in therapy and has been for a while trying to work on them unfortunately she goes back and forth between crying that no one knows how hard it is to live with being such a failure and accusing others of not being deserving of her friendship i want to be there for her i want to help she is been my best friend and she used to be able to be there for me but i am not sure i can handle who she is become and how she is started treating us tldr my friend has serious selfesteem issues and is ruining all of her friendships because she treats everyone like absolute garbage she is getting therapeutic help but i am not sure i am able to stick around long enough for things to get better

1,i joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts thought i had better introduce my self i live in the uk looking back on my life i think i have always had depression it got worse though years ago after the birth of my son i though i had pnd at the time i was always crying felt really low and would panic if i was left alone with the baby it put a huge strain on my marriage and lots of arguments because my husband though i had gone off him i went back to work put could not cope lack of motivation etc but like someone said below i put on a happy face to make people think that i was ok i muddled through for a year then went to see a gp who put me on prozac stupid me came off it after months thinking i was ok slowly the depression came back i was not coping with my job the simplest tasks at work and at home were impossible to face i could not concentrate or make decisions last spring it all got too much i was getting up crying every morning i became agoraphobic i phoned in work and said i could not go in i saw the gp and went on prozac i took months off work i stayed on prozac until last september and then guess what it all came back with a vengeance a few months ago this time i was also feeling suicidal which really scared me so i am now back on the prozac and determined to stay on it i think i have generalized depression made worse by circumstances the birth of my son trying to keep a job down and be a mom and my husband last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital he has been on incapacity benefit ever since so our relationship and our finances have really suffered he has changed to even though he says he loves me he gets angry a lot shouts at me criticizes me puts me down i do not know how much more of it i can take without leaving him i make excuses for him that it is his illness and lack of earning power that make him like that but it is no excuse to turn me into a nervous wreck who is scared to say anything in case he shoots me down the prozac has reduced but not removed my depression and i still have the odd day where i want to run away i keep thinking will it go away if i leave my husband i no longer love him but life has dealt a difficult blow to us both recently and maybe one day when the stresses have been removed i will love him again anyway that has my story sounds similar to vanyas who i have pmd
1,desperately want to want to get better attempted suicide may wasted a week of my life in inpatient was put on the one drug that has ever helped me olanzapine an antipsychotic which i then promptly had an allergic reaction to got off of and crashed again was able to drag myself through some intensive outpatient group therapy for a while and then quit that too the only good thing i have left in my life is my fiancé i know not healthy to live for another person but not exactly in a position to nitpick at this point all i can do for them is try to be as reliable as possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle but i want more i want to be able to grow with them and be an active part of a life they enjoy i want to repay them for all the things they do in vain to try to make me happy but all of my options in recovery range from extremely corny literally all talk therapy individual and group dbt to cbt to emdr to actually detrimental to my health reactions to and side effects from medications what the fuck do i do so i lose the last good thing i have
0,what is wrong with this friendship i need some thoughts on this situation three friends of years decide a month a head of time to go to a gatsby party for new years eve all of them are single well at least one of them is somewhat single the lesssingle one is charlotte charlotte has a new beau who she has been seeing on the low for about two months melanie and jenny can see that charlotte is smitten ok no big deal all is good do you girlfriend just do not lose yourself names have been changed so everyone is planning for the nye party melanie and jenny have their outfits ready to go the dress that charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party so the backup plan is to go the mall and find a new dress melanie goes with her and charlotte reluctantly buys the best dress she can find but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online which again will not arrive on time the ladies planned to all go to melanies house early on the day of nye to slowly get ready play some good music eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the uber to take them to the party the night before however the partys promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location a little aggravating but not a big deal they decide they are not going to let that mess up their nye and want to have fun anyway anyhow on jan at charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies hey ladies i know you will probably hate me for this but i am not going to go i was not feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now james asked me to go to vegas so i rather do that i apologize for the late notice needless to say the other women were very upset any thoughts should the other ladies accept that
1,i guess my last submission got deleted just wanted someone to talk to
1,i think letters are a wonderful way to communicate that way you do not say anything without thinking about it first i was not clear if your mother actually read the letter or not if she has not i might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you without the father issue in one letter that might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first i understand your fear of authority figures when i was that age i am now i could not talk to anyone of authority my mom who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test nana or sonny who you mentioned in the letter if it helps to hear i did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes i go overboard and challenge them to make up for lost time i never had psychotherapy but i wish i had so do not discount it nip it in the bud if you are able to one other question i have is is your mother always this way or does she show moments of tenderness sympathy or interest in your life i think that if you have seen the mom in her in the past it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you but have nothing to do with you do not worry about how you should be at this age everyone has their own time clock inside if we were all the same this would be a very very boring world you sound like an interesting thoughtful man i wish you could see that
0,aibu to think that calling mum and dad mummy and daddy after a certain age is cringe my sister is years old and still refers to our parents as mummy and daddy i cannot be the only one to find this totally cringey i could understand more if it was directed at them but it is to others to when talking about them today we went for a meeting with our landlord and discussing the smell of weed coming from the flat below when she said i do not mind it so much myself but it is just more when mummy and daddy come to visit i do not want them to be smelling it in the hall i felt like disappearing into the ground unamused face just me
0,old possible fibroadenoma yrs old i had a fibroadenoma in my right breast yrs ago and after a biopsy they recommended taking it out because of a small chance it could be a phyllodes tumor dr was sure it was a fibroadenoma which it was now i have another lump on my left breast and due to moving and new insurance i saw a different doctor on friday after feeling it she said it definitely feels like a fibroadenoma ordered an ultrasound and mammogram i just had a routine mammo months ago that was clear she said they may want to do a biopsy depending on how the ultrasound comes out my question is given my age and the fact that this is my lump in years why they do a biopsy off the bat a mammogram and ultrasound will just confirm that the mass is there right i feel the mammogram is unnecessary and just want to get it biopsied this doctor was also a bit dismissive and said have to get a fibrodenoma removed i am leaning heavily towards just taking it out given my age family history maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her late and had a mastectomy with no return of cancer lived to be neither my mom nor my aunts have had bc so not considered super high risk but i do have dense breast tissue
1,reminder that it will get better everyday i get home from my part time job i cry for at least half an hour before i get up to go inside and finish the rest of my day everyday i feel and believe that things just keep getting heavier to deal with that my life will not become healthier and i ever be happy one issues after the next or all at once and i keep wanting sometimes do push it off to the side everyday i also remind myself that it will get better sitting here alone sobbing my eyes out while texting this post i believe it in these moments but not giving myself any other choiceexception i will beat this and be happy depression and anxiety and all that jazz can suck the fun out of life in seconds i want to remind you all that even when you really believe it keep telling yourself be happy and healthy i want all of you to you deserve that at least

0,the city i work in which feels and seems much more like a town has a courthouse square downtown there is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees a beautiful little spot really it really adds to the whole town feeling all sorts of things happen in the town square art festivals performing art festivals food drink tasting local merchant festival and many more well one thing i have noticed since i started working downtown is that people men mainly like to take a midday nap in this courthouse square i lived outside of new orleans before i moved here so at first i thought these nappers were homeless people untill i paid a little more attention to them the majority of these napping people are wearing clean well kept clothes and are cleanshaven in other words they are just people who livework around downtown who like a little afternoon nap they pick a tree lay down and just doze off for a little while i find that kind of interesting

1,what am i afraid of that is an interesting and deadly question if analyzed too casually it can pull you into a neverending pit of distain for oneself if your mind is agreeable to selfdistain my mind it seems has always been agreeable to selfdoubt and selfdeprecation i it must be pointed out am not fond of such thinking and countless hours days weeks in fact years have been spent struggling against this susceptibility in my mind to dwindle everything down to its most melancholy conclusion it is not a trait i accept or a trait i allow but is merely the default setting of my mind to avoid this thinking is to fight against ones natural order is this true i have often hoped not and certainly many have theorized that this could change with much effort and selfimprovement ah yet it is a tricky beast this black hole that sucks the energy in my mind even the positive thought can be twisted and turned into something ugly a sort of distorted aching false happiness that becomes as detrimental as the illness it is meant to cure our lady of perpetual doubt thrives in false hope yet without hope men like me do not survive without hope to succeed is hopeless and although success has not been abundant in my life the little that can be found in its history was certainly built on a foundation of hope and moderate selfbelief this is gobbledygook mental masturbation which has no readership value in the least i am just spouting thoughts but some of those thoughts have an eerie connection with the truth of the last years oh if i could only breath the air that filled my lungs the days before my brain melted down i know life felt differently i was not the happiest of children maybe already bent towards selfdestruction or depression but i breathed freer air life definitely had a different feeling a different perception it was much different for a while as a teenager i could still recall how that felt not in feeling but in memory now the memory is all but completely lost all i know now is that it changed when i was and despite all my growth and lifting out of this disease it was never meant to return that freedom funny how i thought when i was despite the pain i thought it would be all over soon i remember thinking that in a couple years i would not even remember the putrid mental stink that was skewing my vision of the world around me i would get over it something would happen and this dark pit would be left behind and forgotten the dark pit is still here i am managing better than most i imagine but the horrid thing is still here i am not sure if it ever could truly lose itself just its memory could insight its existence i would have been better if it had not been born at all too late it is a part of me now a part of my history a part of my present my unwelcome capture
1,i feel like holding in my anger or at least trying to be nice all the time contributes to me feeling depressed maybe it is a good thing you are experiencing anger maybe you deserve to express those negative emotions of course without hurting anyone i wonder how much my not feeling worthy or feeling powerless contributes to not speaking up holding in angry feelings and in a vicious cycle my depression will feed off feeling powerless or undeserving and create even more feelings of worthlessness vicious cycle because feel like i do not have very good boundaries am not nearly assertive enough when i need to tell people what i need what i want then my resentment anger build up i have definite triggers that make me so angry especially my husband i wish i could beat the s out of him under it i am just so fing hurt and if i can get in touch with the hurt i can express it some how cry write something and of course he can hear me better when i am sharing my being hurti vs screaming throwing things
1,it is extremely difficult for me to cry i used to deal with depression through breaking down and crying at night and it was a really helpful way to out all the negative emotion and i always felt much better after for over a year now it is been extremely difficult for me to cry unless i am pushed to the absolute edge when i feel like i should be crying it is more just a feeling of emptiness this means that i feel like i can never release my feelings and that it feels really greyscale at times and on the rare occasions i can cry it hardly helps as it is basically a panic attack at that point i do not really know why i am posting this but does anyone else deal with this i would love to hear from someone who maybe has advice on how to handle it love all of you
1,dropping out of college i find the point in my classes the confusing and silly assignments they give school was never my thing to be exact i did decent but really ever try to get super good grades that kind of thing just seems silly to me salute to everyone in school or college i hope your doing well i would drop out right now but i know that my family would look down on me they think the only way out for me is school and i hate school with a passion and manage to blow it off everytime i feel like i could go back to college you know go back and get the shit you need but where at right now working only some hours and managing to be broke every week from drug use and other stuff from being so stressed and unhappy i personally feel i would enjoy my life so much better if i have school right now never said that and i just wanted to tell someone idk what going to do but these are my thoughts that i contain at the moment

1,i have been having a difficult time lately in addition to my mental state of disarray i have a medical condition that can affect my mood my medication has changed lately my body has not caught up the difference yet the last few days have been particularly bad especially at night the familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg scissors halfdozen lines my usual though in the past i would sometimes keep cutting until my selfhatred was momentarily spent pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more i am not proud i knew it was not the best way to cope i did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound and of lavish aftercare i washed it out with rubbing alcohol which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infectionfree covered everything with a jumbo bandaid the kind kids put on skinned knees and have not dared to look since afterward i was afraid that i was back to my old ways i told myself in nearhysterics that this was strictly a onetime backslide the surprising part is that i believed myself this does not make me a cutter again this does not mean that i have lost everything that i have gained all it means is that i have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope my situation will improve my body chemistry will even out it is better not to cut but i am not a bad person even if i do cut the words are stupidly simple i do not care they are my magic that keeps me going
1,i am a hetero man divorced no kids i can honestly say that i feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons just as i have shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff i am beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a woman issue it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes the things i have noticed the most are my friends unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the bedridden variety that i have gone through or maybe this is their way of not feeling completely weak most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff i tried to drink it all away but in the end it just made me feel worse i tried tranquilizers but that did not work i tried booze and pills together but still the depression lingered now i just smoke cigarettes and go running what a dichotomy i know but whatever works right the only woman i have ever known who is not empathetic or sympathetic to my depression is my mother
1,just the idea of life makes me depressed why do i even try i really do not know i have a job i hate with a shit boss that blames me for every little thing only to make money so i can buy the things i like so i keep on living i know i am not going to get anything better i suck at everything i like to do so i cannot have really get a job about my passion never had a relationship and probably never will i have never even met anyone who had a crush on me or anything and i do not look bad something pretty bad got blamed on me again at work and my boss is coming back from her vacation tomorow i really do not want to get scolded and start crying in front of customers i am the nicest person there and i only made or mistakes since i have been there but for some reason she still seems to hate me i just have nothing that makes me want to keep living except maybe my love for video games if i get yelled at again i do not know what ill do i just hate living in general if you can even call it living more like slaving your life away to me anyway i am just venting here if you want to share your feelings you are welcome i will read them when i can
1,ok i am having problems speaking to people about this so i thought i would try the internet i am years old and a student about years ago i had an experience that changed my life my dad got himself a new girlfriend that is where the problems started i will not go into the tedious details unless you want me too but basically this led to me developing an eating disorder and a serious case of social phobia i used to lock myself in my room and only go downstairs for tea literally this lasted about years i suppose years being alone would be enough to disrupt anyones life anyway i have got over the eating disorder but the social disorder remains despite all my best efforts let me give you a few examples of how my life is at the moment i cannot even go to the local supermarket because the staff always want to socialize i have to force myself to go down the launderette because i do not want to be around other people the list is endless can you imagine what its like being a student and not wanting to be in social situations my social skills have seriously degraded over the years and i desperately want at least one friend but i do not know where to start i moved out because i could not cope but now i lock myself away hours a day and read my lecture notes over the internet basically i have no friends no money and an addiction to alcoholi was stupid thought it would solve my problems and today i have found out that the bank will not lend me any more money and i cannot get a job working with others everyday is just inconceivable i have a counseling appointment on the of may but i cannot wait that long things could not get any worst i do not know why i am writing this but i guess i want someone to talk to that does not know me so i suppose i am looking for a penpal or just someone to talk to and to make things worst i think i might be depressed why else would i be crying while i am writing this any views on this would be appreciated i cannot keep going like this
0,tonight was a momentous night apologies to kelly holmes but while she was achieving her dream of olympic gold my mind was elsewhere at just about the same time my daughter ellie took three teetering first steps and our house errupted in a state ot total euphoria in the seconds following the great event ellie lost her focus and tumbled towards the ground only to be swept up in a bear hug and given another chance we were not disappointed that ellie only managed three steps or even that she fell her triumphant grin and clapping hands were enough to melt the coldest of hearts i cannot help but wonder if god ever feels the same way about me maybe sometimes i focus too much on the end result and not enough on the joy of having a god who is there when i throw myself on him in an attempt to do something i could never do without him i think next time something does not go my way i might try to take a leaf out of ellies book perhaps i will clap my hands grin triumphantly and try again realising that a little progress can be a pretty big deal and to kelly holmes mother i think i know how you feel
0,my bio dad died and his family did not tell me until days later him and i were never very close probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of i believe it started at because i had sent him a letter wanting to have a relationship with him i just wanted to know my dad even if it was not a super close relationship i still wanted one well fast forward years later he is in the hospital for nearly a month and no one tells me not even his sister who i am in contact daily with finally he passes away last thursday he was intubated and could not speak for most of his hospital stay he was i asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened their reasoning i had vented at a few points saying i wished he was dead normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth i am also not invited to the service should i feel duped should i feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we were not on the best of terms because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i do not even deserve to grieve all i wanted was a relationship with him and all i got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the he had to pay in child support each month i was not very nice to him i tried to be but he made it so hard so was it really they are call to say i could not see him or am i right to feel this way

1,i need help to understand it myself dear people of i need advice for motivation and mental calmness i have had my share of depression in the past but i have tried hard so hard to make my life as happy as i could but i think recently i have lost all my motivation for everything there are days where i just want to play games and sleep all day because that probably is the only way to keep me bloody sane then there are days where i completely fine but i do not think i have the same fire in me when i was younger recent mistakes failing in my university units failing to find a job failure in relationship are making me nihilistic self loathing and just feeling really pathetic but of course i cannot just keep using my mistakes as an excuse to not get the fuck up and do something with my life but i think i have ran out of ideas and motivation to push myself anymore
0,like to share a quote i particularly like find comfort among those who agree with us growth among those who frank a clark how are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us when you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with other people who believe what you do although i have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities i have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like i am the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you but as far as growth goes i feel i learn more by talking to someone about a topic that we are opposed on rather than have the same feelings when i come across a good conversation like this try to remember to share it

1,hey all i moved away from my home town years ago and have only gone back for short visits and never met up with any of the people i used to hang around with these girls still live in the town and still after all these years talk of me and not nice either the reason i know this is because another friend told me i am not putting them down but the only reason i can think of is because they are angry and jealous of me as i have been on a sort of adventure instead of staying home and being a single mum i really cannot think what i did that was so bad to them that they still put me down and hate me they even shouted out my name then said is a i was with my mum and it was awful i was excited about moving there but now i am dreading it and i am petrified incase they decide to start making my life bad when it will be a struggle educating my family on my illness i just do not know what to and i would appreciate any advice please hiddenlady
1,i have really hit a new low i cannot believe how depressed i am right now i am just imploding i got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual usually i am pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me i am a damn failure three attempts at college flunked out after the first year that is ok college is not for everyone try a bunch of min wage jobs get fired or quit with in the first month or two i cannot do damn thing i have no motivation to do anything at all anymore i used to clock around hours a day gaming because it was something i genuinely enjoyed i have gotten minutes in an entire damn week i literally just cannot muster the strength to want to do it i have been pulling away from people because it is just exhausting to talk to them i literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation it is insane we will barely be through the how does your day been going before i already want to go somewhere else because it is so draining i have hit a complete rock wall in therapy i tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there is only so much she is able to do she has no magic way of instilling me with motivation like to put it into perspective i stared at a wall for hours today because i just was to tired to anything else hours i was not thinking about anything i was not being bored i just do not have motivation to do anything but what is worse is the moment i start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me it is like i am in the middle of a vast dark ocean and cannot find shore i swim and i swim and i swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen and i am beginning to grow tired i have no future ahead of me nothing to look forward too i go through thousands of career tests and applications and all i see is that i am either not interested enough or not good enough for any career and i cannot simply work for money money in and of itself just is not good enough for me to work at a job i hate or am completely uninterested in that is the strain of these minimum wage jobs some of them i have had to quit because they have literally made me suicidal i am so lost right now the world looks like a very dark place where i have to suffer in agony just to get by i am so tired of fighting i am so tired of trying i am just so tired it has been a very long time since i have been this low i feel like i am doomed like this is all the happiness i will ever be afforded that even if i get the job of my dreams and all the money i could possibly want i will always have a big dark cloud hanging over my head everything hurts and i hate everything about life right now i wish i could just fall asleep and stay in my dreams
1,i am irrelevant no friends unable to make any no family i do not have anybody literally no relationships no potential of attaining i am the definition of a loser in modern society the last advice i got was to kill myself at this point just here to vent
1,my mother pt i posted about my issues with my mother the other day and i have discovered new information she is been complaining to her boyfriend and he has a busy mouth so naturally he is spilled it all i have learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after i lost my apartment and she is been saying she buys me lots of things clothes computers etc and i just toss them aside and never use them because i am an ungrateful child so she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes none of that is true what is probably going on here is that she is buying herself things and using me as a scapegoat so she does not have to tell her boyfriend she has money or bought things for herself or she is just delusional and making shit up maybe even that she is stealing clothes from me and covering that way i could believe any of that either way she wants me to leave and i know she does and that hurts like a mother no pun intended what i want to do is get custody of my younger brother and leave the state just start over and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment because i cannot live with knowing that he is growing up in the same toxicity that i did and how it will fuck him up like it did me she is twofacing everyone talking shit to one person then smiling to the persons face she just trashed and if anyone tries to call her out she gets pissed and plays dumb her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house she does drugs on the daily she is going to end up old a lone and with her kids and family hating her no one coming to see her i am ready to disown her it just hurts why is she like this why does it have to be this way it hurts
1,well i am new here so here goes nothing i have been diagnosed clinically depressed along with obsessive compulsive disorder i am years old i have been divorced once and have since re married i have children year old boy stepson and year old girl i work for a state government agency repairing computers so far so good right well the major problems i am having is becoming a social recluse i have a really hard time letting things go in i lost both my sister suicide and my father heart attack and those events only added to the trauma i would been going through i live in a small town so when i went to the doctor about possible adhd i was moody could not focus on work could not complete tasks on time etc they determined i was bipolar and put me on effexor and wellbutrin well that just did absolutely nothing in fact my anger with the world increased dramatically and i had rage episodes that about destroyed my second marriage i have had a lot of rage in the past recently i have not had any outbursts i am currently taking cymbalta and celexa and that seems to be a good combination but i still have a hard time going to work and functioning throughout the day i would rather stay at home in my bedroom away from people most of the time that is what bothers me i am on antidepressants but it does not seem to help me get motivated to face the world does that come from within is there no magic pill that will all of a sudden make me feel confident i guess that is good enough for now i have a ton of mental history but do not want to flood anybody
0,so here i sit at work only three more hours left i guess that is not so bad it is over time so that makes it even better this online blog idea was very clever the user interface is very easy to use i like it so when is it too soon to say i love you to someone or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions i do not think there is i use to i use to never believe in love at first sight but just because you do not believe in something does not mean it is not there it is amazing how i use to think when someone would say oh you will know when you have found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with i would think to myself how can that possibly be how can you possibly know that just after meeting someone use to think it was all just movie talk hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise but i believe it now i think deep down in my heart i had always wanted to believe it but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down an ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up because he kept asking me if i see him in my future i kept telling him i do not know because well i do not he kept asking if i had hopes for us to be together again and i said no i do not have hopes for anything never have it is better to have never hoped for anything then to have been let down by those false hopes but is it better to have loved and lost then to have never loved going through the break up i began thinking it is better to have never loved but in recent events i could not change my mind quick enough i would rather have loved and lost the joy of being with that one person and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same is priceless well there is quite alot there to read hehe i guess i should probably get some work done

0,my japanese friends just got back from a visit to toronto they found the people there much more patient and easy to communicate with than here in gainesville fl and toronto is probably the most americanized city in canada another proof that canadians are a more considerate breed but why is that all canadians envy you when they find out you are in florida most of them have not lived here that is why sure the sunshine is nice no snow is good too but if you ask me the most important thing about a place is the culture of the people eager canadians who head south for the warm weather will gradually come to realize there is no place like home
1,what to do with my life i just turned in june and really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace i was never good in school only because i hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now i moved away for college at for a whole year and only passed a few classes because i care that much i came home and decided to take the year off in that year off i grow as a person and i feel empty all i do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout my parents are complaining that i have no girl friend no life and anti social not anti social i just feel so empty and lost that i feel like doing anything anymore i even know if i can go back to school because of my grades were and i was lucky enough to get into school i want to move out i just want to go to school and come home as quickly as i can no friends nothing this lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point do i kill myself the point of living if i finish school and get a job why live if just gunna work min wage my whole life lately been asking myself this everyday what do i do with my life is there really a point in living if i become a engineer doctor lawyer etc all my friends are doing great but just at the bottom and i understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that even at school in my early and living at home already missed out of going away for university i really feel like killing my self is the last option i have because if not be homeless because i want to hurt my parents anymore with the embarrassment of a child i am and live at home what do i do
1,having a really bad stretch of days hi all i know this sub moves kind of fast but i just wanted to vent hopefully some of you read this so my story is that i have had depression and social anxiety for about years or so at least that is when i recall starting to feel off i am now because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that i am unhappy i put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which i started going to therapy it had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early december for me to finally reach out for help in my sessions we have been working on techniques to combat both my sa and depression these include going to places alone such as coffee shops yoga classes shopping malls etc keep in mind i have functioning social anxiety where i can physically be around people but i am extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people the thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my sa contributes to that it is been a big step for me to try and go out on my own but i have been doing it almost every day even though it does not seem to be creating any improvement unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult i am getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will fix me i tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and i could not even do that i started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack so i decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm i feel miserable again today and i am just running out of steam to keep going i really do not know what to do anymore i am exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison i have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore the couple of friends that i have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for years and for good reason i know nobody has answers as to what i should do but i just needed to rant

1,what music do you guys listen to cope with this curse we call deppresion for me i listen to metal and rock it really helps thumbs up
1,i wish the world would start working the way i want it to but i know that nothing i could do to change this world to make me happy
1,sometimes i worry i let my mental illness be my excuse it feels easy to justify staying up late not eating properly not going out or not doing xyz because i am unwell it feels impossible to differentiate between me being unwell and me not using it as an excuse i feel like i know who i am when i am well and i am never awake at am or failing a piece of work etc but do i allow myself to trap myself longer by not trying harder letting it be an excuse i have no way to tell really i think i have been depressed so long now that i cannot even remember what normal is or tell if my changes in character are related to being unwell or to me changing if anyone wants to chat at all i would enjoy that
0,is this my distorted reality okay i almost always run into this problem with friends and i am not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend situation one there is this friend whom i helped many times and every single time other people bashed me she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me things like asking me to fix her phone helping her find a place to rent providing her with advice on many issues i have since asked her not to further ridicule me and her response was oh this is not what i do but i would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently i kind of ghosted her after i graduated from university but i always wondered whether i handled the situation appropriately she always tries to avoid me in public space but when she gets into a car accident she would call me and ask for help i am neither interested nor in love with her i actually felt she might be in a hopeless state that is why she wanted my help scenario two i have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy i am they made assumptions about my contributions to me and my so and said things like oh if given the opportunity would you kill so is name and claim his insurance policy you know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right the fact is i have been contributing to the relationship between my so my so is older than me so in a way my so is more financially independent at times when so is helping me out i always mark the number down so i know how much i owe so actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices but i will not disclose such details to my friends i am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing i want is to be the victim in every fing relationship is there something i am not seeing here is there a problem with how i am handling the situation well
1,am i depressed or just selfpitying i do not really understand what counts as depression but i have had no motivation to really do anything since as long as i can remember sometimes i get a burst of motivation and try to do something but i give up really easily it is really easy to say that i am depressed as an excuse for the way i feel but i am still able to function so i do not think i can say i am i still shower eat go to work even the gym sometimes i am not really close with my family i rarely talk to them and its only when they talk to me and i am okay with that since i do not really feel like i want to or could hold a conversation with them friends i have i hang out with them sometimes but half the time it feels like a lot of work i have a girlfriend and i cling to her so hard because i am so happy when i am with her and when i am not with her i am always thinking of her and get sad that i am not with her she recently told me that the way i think of relationships is immature and she cannot offer that much time to me since she has other friends who need her too and get mad at her for not soending enough time with them i cannot let go of the way i think relatiomships should be and i want her to reciprocate even if i know it is irrational and i do not feel like anything else in life is really worth living for i am not suicidal though there is a few times it crossed my mind but i always think about how i would not really ever do it or start regretting it while thinking about it because what if things do get better other times i feel like going to sleep one night and not waking up would be nice though
1,ashamed of being depressed i have never been diagnosed with depression but i think that i am there girlfriend decided she needed space so that took me down more found a car i really wanted but after days of number crunching i decided i could not afford my exiting car and house repairs keep racking up i have few friends and live alone honestly i feel bad every day i get to work an hour late and dread it for no reason it is not hard and i generally enjoy it while i am there i feel almost certain that i am depressed but why i feel bad about that i own my own house my own car and have no real money problems yet i feel like shit constantly my sister is a recovering addict i have seen how low people can go yet i am not even close i have generally been lucky and have done reasonably well for myself yet i still feel down no real life partner to speak of very few friends but i feel that being upset and down about it is wrong because so many people have it so much worse is that wrong i do not know this week has been very bad for me
0,there are things running through my head today what should i do about my future i have a decent job an apartment a relationship but what do i want to do with my life there are many things i have wanted to do when i was in high school i wanted to be a broadcaster when i was in college while things became less clear i knew that i wanted to study english and tudor history and combine them somehow or another now that i am out of school all i want is to go back to do something different to be something more than what i am so here are some things i have thought about doing i have not really thought them through all the way but that is what this sort of forum is for right i have always wanted to write books either researching stuff from the elizabethan or early tudor time period or historical based romances or even just plain old fiction the problem is what would i write about there are already tons of books about elizabeth i her sister mary her cousin mary stuart it is a bit frustrating but i suppose there is always room for a well researched well written book out there i have thought about studying to become a teacher but what would i teach english or history on what level would i teach i am not the most patient person in the world i would hate teaching in an elementary school or even a middle school so i guess that leaves high school and college levels i would enjoy having the summers off but probably not much else i would love to be able to travel for months out of every year or even travel for month and work the other doing something else it is a possibility i guess i should look into the law has also fascinated me from a young age i would love to be a lawyer i should look into law schools at least to find out the requirements all in all i think what i am doing now is good for me it is making me question what i should be doing and what i could be doing that is never a bad thing is it
1,just wanted to let it out i want to kill myself i am seriously depressed and i cannot bring myself to trust in others and tell them maybe because i can leave myself the option if no one knows to stop me if i want to go but for now i guess i will keep hiding it it is nice to be able to say it though even if no one on here sees it

0,so these two girls published an article in the school newspaper about the cliques in my school it is a horrible article like get shot in the head and die in it they listed what cliques exist at my schoolthe asians it is funny they list that as the first one because that is the clique they belong to the brown kids the ghetto group the cheerleadersjockspreps the punks the goths and the druggies okay what the hell there are kids at my school that could be labeled punk two of them are actually punks and one of them is a good friend of mine the other one is a girl who used to be punk but now she is all not this entire article is about how we should not be labeling kids because hey that is what causes cliques and then they go and categorize every student at the school assholes and then they thought it would be nice to teach me about these cliques students feel acceptance and approval when they are with their own people how does one come to be labeled as a part of one of these cliques the way one speaks dresses common interests and tracking levels tracking levels okay i have no idea what that means students who can be categorized in more than one clique are considered confused for example we were listening to two studens in our class talk about a boy who likes to dress more urban but he listens to rock music at the same time people were making fun of the boy behind his back saying he was confused cry me a fucking river the article goes on about stupid shit saying that the two most segregated clubs in my school are deca and the multicultural club ironically they are in both oh i do not want to join that club it is so asian what the hell people use that as an excuse they ended it by saying that the only way to change this is to make a difference within fucking hippies on that note all i have to say is we can dance if we want to we can leave your friends behind because your friends do not dance and if they do not dance well they are no friends of mine amen

0,not good enough greetings everyone i am currently in need of venting my thoughts reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people like myself i have come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes so heres the scoop growing up i was always compared to a specific relative i will not say which because i am a paranoid fucker but we shared the same gender were of similar ages and were always very different from each other still we were extremely close the biggest difference was our weight yes i was always the larger one people enjoyed to point it out but what really stung was that our own family would as well fast forward to years later when we were in our teenage years it became so much more than our weight our family started comparing our physical appearances they were always the more attractive one the more successful one we are both adults now our grandmother speaks wonders of this person and only has negative things to say about me despite all of this i was always deemed the nicer one that has not mattered a single bit i constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls because i give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material she is very sick and i assume quite close to death i pick up because i feel massive guilt when i ignore her calls while my eversobetter relative ignores them with no problem and is still worshipped i have considered cutting ties with my entire family i do not believe they genuinely care about me yeah i am struggling bad i am basically at rock bottom right now still i highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all i do not think i will ever be the picture perfect grandchild child sibling whatever it drowns me deep in selfloathing every day

1,i feel like nothing matters so why try hey guys i have decided to turn to reddit to try to get some help with my lack of motivation recently i have felt like nothing matters in the end and nothing i do makes a difference we are on a random rock floating through space in a universe that is bigger than we could ever fathom and we do not understand and we think that things that we do matter i feel like i have heard just because nothing matters does not mean you cannot be happy a thousand times and while it sounds good i cannot get passed my negative view on things i honestly wish that i thought that way but that is not how i think i guess i posted this to try to get different perspective if anyone has gone through the same thing could you let me know how you changed your outlook on life
1,an open letter dear you it is been three years since we decided to go our separate ways we both had different goals desires and aspirations we were perfect together but just at the wrong time i am sorry things ended badly i am sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control i am sorry i am sorry i let you down your family down i am sorry i buckled i am sorry i did not have the experience or the knowhow to react to certain situations i am sorry that i made mountains out of molehills i am sorry at times i treated you badly that at times i held you back three years later we live totally different lives than back then i got that job i traveled the world i went to italy twice i have been to times square at midnight and so have you i did it all but by myself it is not what i wanted it is not what i envisioned you cannot just replace somebody special with another person and that you were special it is been three years despite some triumphs and successes it still feels like i lost a war an immense failure that did not personify my persona it personified myself on the surface i am told i seem ambitious fully ready to attack each day on the inside i feel defeated in the end you found somebody new which is fine i chose whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path i have tried new women many beautiful on the outside but they am not you oh no no no they all do not have what you had not even close maybe one day i will end this crusade against myself against the past i cannot change it i cannot alter the story i cannot lie to myself i wish i could tell you i am sorry but it would not change anything for you it is a battle that was fought long ago for me i relive it more times than i would care to admit i am emotionally crippled distraught defeated it is been a long three years i am ready for it to be over i am sorry yours truly me

1,i know what to do anymore so tired of my doctor telling me there will be a perfect medication so tired of trying and it not working just tired i feel like not good enough and i have a hard time trying to just get out of bed everyday i just want to be happy my current meds just make me feel angry i know worse we are going to try something new and i pray it works i am not doing enough for my family and my therapist just says keep trying and she knows i can push out of the bad places but i just have the energy to keep fighting it on my own anymore
1,i am and fighting with my depression for almost years now i had psychosomatic problems all the time until july i was on medication with ssri selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors which helped me a lot but never completely and then for some months none now i consulted another doctor and decided to try with different medicine called remeron but my question might sound not related i somehow think that contraceptive pills antibaby pills that i used somehow contributed to my state of art i used them for months because my gynecologist advised she thought that i had some problem with hormones she did not even check my blood and when i stopped with this therapy i experienced total breakdown of the system now this pills somehow simulate pregnancy and there is phenomenon of postpartum depression the baby blues and the women over quite often develop depressions hormones again so i would like to ask if somebody had similar experience with contraceptive pills
1,i am new to any kind of discussion like this i am new to any kind of support like this i go to therapy once a week or rather i did but it was not really making a large difference i am going to be twentytwo soon and my life is nowhere how i wish it to be the funny part is that to get it where i would like it all i would have to do is go out and get a job start working i just cannot seem to leave the house i am not a shut in or anything i love people i try and keep friends with everything but i get self conscious all the time my early life was pretty difficult when it came to that getting bullied badly for wearing glasses and being a bit of a dork i never really learned those little social rules that everyone else did sometimes i just feel like i am not on everyones page and nothing seems to help i became a father at nineteen and it was difficult i loved my girlfriend very much at the time and dropped out of school to support her and our daughter i love my daughter she is everything my girlfriend left me for another man when our daughter was four weeks old i cannot help but feel insecure about this logically i should know she is just not so bright or genuine a person with me but i cannot help but feel part of it was me she stopped letting me see my daughter a short time after i had to go to court and battle things out the only accomplishment i have made in the last year that i could feel proud about was to get partial custody and three days a week with her i am attentive and loving father i have a great relationship with my little girl but i cannot feel good about it sometimes it is like as soon as she is gone i forget she was even here i spend all day in the house like a zombie i am either on the computer or at the tv watching baseball i know i want to have a healthy and happy life and i want to have money and security for my daughter but i cannot motivate myself to do anything my parents were never attentive and fight constantly but i am twentyone and should be over that instead it makes me more down now than it ever has i am like a giant pit of negativity all the time i was involved with a girl but that faded quick and just like everything else it brought me down i do not do drugs or drink but sometimes i really want to funny part is that i have never felt any kind of relief doing them in the past in fact usually my insecurities and negativity are worse i feel like i need to get moving soon or i will never get moving i tried killing myself after my girlfriend stopped letting me see my daughter i know how bad that was for me i know how i made others feel and i know how miserable i was i do not ever want to get that way again but for some reason and i just do not understand i cannot get myself to get moving

1,hi everybody i am new here and i want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions i am now female i am studying on phd in one of the us universities i have been suffering from different kinds of psychological problems mainly depression for years already i always tried to handle my depression by myself and only once when depression became unbearable i went to psychiatrist i had therapy and ad for a few months that was about years ago now i have strong depression again i feel that i cannot handle it by myself and that i am tired of fighting it on my own that is why i have scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist my questions i feel that this depression is different from depressions i experienced before i started to masturbate like crazy times a day and cannot stop it has been like this for a few weeks already and i seriously started to think about involving in some homosexual relationship which i have never done before i also started to read a lot of porno stories i am thinking almost constantly about suicide i mean i do not think about committing suicide no i want to live it is kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind i feel bad suicide many people do that suicide it is kind of always in my mind sometimes i even have a feeling of the rope on my neck i do not think about other kinds of suicide which is probably explained by the fact that my father hung himself where am i going guys am i going to some serious psycho disease or what am i still normal i feel like i am still normal have you ever experienced something like this honestly what i am afraid of is that at some point i might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts i think this is what happened to my dad i have been here in the us only for year so i do not know how the system works if i come to a psychiatrist and tell her that i have these suicidal thoughts will she make me to be in the hospital i hate even think about this should i even tell her about that should i be very honest and open when i went to our university health center to get a referral form i did not say anything about that so i am a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist maybe i do not need to tell her everything what would be your advice i would greatly appreciate your help thanks

0,advice to restore lost friendship my cousin and i used to be best friends when we were little we told each other everything and were inseparable then a bunch of terrible stuff happened to her around middle school and in high school she shut herself away even though we used to tell each other everything she did not talk to me as much after that i love her and i wanted her to know she could trust me like she always could but she did not talk to me or anyone else then she moved a whole state away for a couple years we drifted apart far apart i used to consider her my very best friend but at that point i did not feel that way anymore she now lives close to me again and we have started hanging out again i feel like we are starting to get our friendship back but i still feel like there is something preventing us from getting back to how we used to be when we were little she has depression and anxiety as a result of everything she has been through i want her to know i am there for her and that she can trust me completely i do know her well enough that i can tell when she is having a hard time with something and today i could tell she was struggling i asked how she was doing and she was upset because she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately i asked her more about it but she did not want to talk about it that is completely fine i understand and i told her as much and also let her know i am always here for her if she needs anything now i say all of that to ask this how can i let her know that she can open up to me without sounding too pushy i want to regain what we once had how can i restore that closeness we used to have

0,mom always trying to ask me uncomfortable questions and gets mad when i express my feelings about them i am years old and i have been with my boyfriend a little over years i know i am young will my relationship last forever there is a good chance it will not because both of us are very young however that does not mean i do not know how to be in a relationship or know if i love someone or not my mom has a bad habit of asking really odd seemingly disrespectful questions to me and my brother about our relationships a popular one she gives me is i do not think you love him he is more like you friend she asked me this tonight over a phone call and i got upset with her and expressed how i feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that like she knows everything about my relationship somehow when i hardly tell her anything about it because her and my dad are quite old fashioned and very religious she is told me things like this many times before and usually i try to just try to brush it off but i am trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother she went on to say say but i am your mom i can ask things like that i understand she has a much different point of view especially because she is older but i just personally feel it is disrespectful to say that i do not love my boyfriend and that he is just a friend she kind of rolled her eyes at me flatly said goodnight and hung up am i overreacting i feel like i should not be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me my parents have both lacked communication skills my whole life and it is put us in a rocky relationship i love my mom but i am just trying to get her to understand modern day relationships and me as pretty much a grown adult thoughts

1,being told by my brother making friends that hard for someone my age bothers me every time i think about it pretty damn hard when i have no hobbies to relate to anyone except stay in my room on my computer because rather just be away from everyone so i make it hard on them and being told to go to clubs by my parents i just feel more of a disappointment when i tell them nothing interested in and that i also am too afraid to still be alone when i join one done everything i could in my life to try to fit in or make new friends and a reason why i have no motivation to try any of these anymore and then they say it hurt trying that be any further from the truth if i try to fit in again and still have anyone to talk to going to hate my life even more like trapped i do anything to please me one day i want friends then the next i want anybody at my school to bother me because i know they really want me to be there friend why does depression always put you in a trap that you get out of no solution except accept your problem and just be an introvert and ignore everyone
0,in an awkward situation with my best friend she wants me to tell how i feel towards her how should i been friends with her for years a lovely person and i really like her but there were some occasions where i felt weird around her she apparently sensed it and recently asked me wrong between us telling i should tell her if something some of the things thinking of telling her are she often kind of invites herself when she learns i hang out with my friends and invites other people that i know well as well without asking me when i organise something picnic trip etc a nice person and means well but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings for example she said she wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how like in bed when i was having a difficult time after a breakup and she often assumes broke and i feel sort of belittled she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends like gossip i could list several things but not sure if i should be upfront as she has social anxieties and i want her to feel bad or scared in social situations or are there nicer ways to put them also i should probably mention that i have a small circle of friends and basically been my only friend that i get to see regularly been really good friends with a girl b that i met partly through her for the past few months i enjoy hanging out with her a and we text each other all the time but not sure how she a feels about this thanks for taking your time to read this i appreciate it xpost

1,i am a year old married stay at home mom to kids i was diagnosed with depression about years ago after some major problems in my marriage although i have been in and out of depression for the last years i was put on prozac took that for years and made the mistake of taking myself off it so i am right back where i started from i think for me a lot of it is my life should have been so much different i should not have gotten married at even though i love him should have finished college etc there are so many should haves you know i have been suicidal though not for a long time i know there are things i need to do for my kids and my family but many days i just cannot bring myself to do them what is wrong with me even though i know the answer i ask the question every day why cannot i be normal why cannot i just be a wife and a mother and have that be enough i wish everyone well in this terrifying journey we all have to endure
0,i could only admire you from afar can never tell how i trully feel i would rather be silent alone than to lose you forever since i was in the early stages of my maturity i have long searched for someone who would care for me often disturbed by the sight of have found themselves intimately i strived to obtain a personal connection of my own because of the envy that consumed me at the time i rushed blindlessly into the raging sea of affection not knowing the consequences it would have and so it has engulfed me in its massive whirlpools of chance eventually it drowned me in great depression as each opportunity failed i was lost confused and even desperate but soon found out the irrepressible truth that nobody could ever learn to love someone as hideous as me society the same one who offered all ideas of emotional optimism has created these conformities that forever embody sentimental cynicism and hypocrisy as said in a movie for stripes spots for a stripe a spot we could never be maybe paranoid maybe delusional or maybe right i have grown much learned many things and known much about myself as an individual as well as my emotional capacities to handle situations but no matter how much developed it will never please people a handsome face a hot muscular physique a nice sports car wild sex these are just a few things most people look for in a relationship is she one of these people people who look for the real essence of being together when they are not content with their partner or they have not sufficed there bodily appetites only met her for a few months we have spent little time together and still learning yet my knowledge about her seems limited thus disabling my abilities to fully please her this is hopeless i am paranoid i do not know how and constantly afraid of the consequences my actions can bring i am delusional hoping she will be with me as time grows and old and weary alas i am right i have no chance to at all so i worship you from a corner wanting to tell you what i really feel about you however the thought of losing you weakens me even more rather sleep tonight crying id rather be empty inside rather be soulless than not see you again
0,the fall of the pure a tear falls from my eye into the sea where has it gone this thing called humanity my tear is lost in the great abiss of purity where dwells a style so sweet and free the swells of sweetest revelry where friends are not lost and love does not end where the signs of the time are not peoples sins where hatred and darkness are not known where the beautiful are not alone it lightens up each soul with truth and all are hearkened to the light of youth such in these souls is purity a neverending and lovely chastity but while man reigns so does hate it floods our souls and swells over the gates the purity wanes the truth wavers the hate holds fast and we await a saviour when will he come to take away our doubt for all this pain cannot be what existance is about what light he giveth me i pass to you and hope that your soul will to hope hold true
0,a question about honesty in communication my friend recently graduated from business school with a degree after or years however she continually asks me very simple basic business questions that many nonbusiness majors would know stuff that i would think would have been covered over the first few classes she is originally from a different country and still struggles a bit with english yet she went to school in canada where all the courses were taught in english the way i see it if there was that much of a language barrier she would not have been able to pass even if she had gotten help with her studies she still would have needed to retain this knowledge long enough to pass her exams which were not that long ago the only thing i can fathom is that she had other people doing her work for her and taking her exams but i do not want to believe that and besides it is a bit of a stretch as well she currently has a mentor who is supposedly helping her conduct business research yet she still messages me with questions about assignments they have given her saying she does not understand basic stuff i even told her that if she does not understand what her mentor is assigning her she should be forthright and tell them otherwise they would not be able to fully help her she agreed but i noticed she is still asking me the same questions insteading of contacting her mentor anyone have any insight into this i have brought up similar things with her that i felt did not make sense or were inconsistent but she is rarely honest preferring to answer dismissively or cryptically not sure how to proceed from here
1,i just recently got a test back in one of my classes and saw that i totally failed it now i am worried about this class and i cannot afford to repeat anything literally and figuratively i am older so i do not have the time to go screw around and repeat classes and i am sick of school as it is i hate the uphill battle just barley hanging on why i did great in high school with a gpa and i made straight as a couple times in middle school other people breeze through school and it makes me angry that it is such a struggle for me just to get cs in college i am sick of this i want it all to end and i still have a whole year after this semester and even that is not a guarantee the way things are going just needed to rant
1,anyone elses depression feel like this good day this might be weird but stick with me i sufferedsuffer from depression basically from middle school to about a year ago when i finally started on medication the best way i could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me about me about what other people are thinking or saying about me turning positives into negatives etc i started playing a game called hellblade senuas sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis and the main character has many voices in her head here is the opening possible trigger warning as soon as i heard all the voices calling senua names putting her down laughing at her etc i was like holy shit that was me i am not trying to say i havehad psychosis i just thought that the voices thing felt like what i went through my voice telling me terrible things spinning stories like someone else in my head working against me anyone else feel like senuame

1,postgraduation depression i recently graduated from college and over the past couple of months grown increasingly depressed i feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world shocking to me is that i honestly hated college i was either working or studying i rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious now i have a great job live with my girlfriend have almost no debt thanks to working so much in college and live in my ideal area my life is comparatively so much better but i feel this knot in my stomach as if i just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now finally seeing how much of myself given up to get to where i am life feels devoid of adventure and i feel like i have no passion left struggled with depression for a long time but weird to have it catch up with me at the point in my life where past sacrifices were meant to mitigate it

1,i am trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back and i have got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me problem is he is got this need for me to go out there and change the world he keeps saying i need to be better than everyone in my class and that i need to be hyper prepared before i even start class i do not mind boning up on the class material beforehand but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts he also wants me to study anatomy because as he says anatomy does not really change so i can be the go to person with whom all my classmates will want to study i am really bright and would like to make something out of myself but he is got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon i do not even know for certain what i want to be at this point getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting all this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps i need to take to make anything at all happen when i try to tell him it is too much pressure we wind up in a shouting argument actually i wind up doing most of the shouting he just has this way of pressing my buttons i have spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that meanwhile he is afraid that i am going to spend my life playing video games a reasonable fear at the moment he keeps saying lately that i need to move out of childhood but he wants to parent me rrbleh is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments and without letting him pressure me
1,years old with depression attempted suicide multiple times including at my old primary school turing in a few days but not excited just always sad my life is great besides bullying and getting left out of thing i just got back from school break on school break i was fine but now depressed again school that makes me depressed and i know what to do i want therapy because i want to tell my mum only my brother and some close friends know i do things to distract myself like gaming but if bad it just keeps staying in my head i get really bummed and want to do anything i was reading some of other stories earlier everyone here is truely great
1,i cannot stop dreaming about having friends i do not know why i use this daydreaming technique every single day i cannot trust real people because they always seem selfish to me i have that weird twisted image of having a best friend who does not judge me and enjoys spending time with me but it is not real people are not perfect and i push them away or worse i do not and they use me or tease me forever because apparently i am too kind and i act like a stray animal what should i do i am so lost how can i escape my dreams i am and i do not have any close friends and i end up talking to my cats or my plushy because interacting with humans makes me incredibly tense i am on meds i was beaten i sometimes talk too loudly or too quietly because i was a shutin for a year and i cannot control my voice sometimes maybe that is the problem how to quit chatting with my imaginary friends so i am less lonely and depressed
1,i think i am in an abusive friendship and i do not know what to do one of my close friends with borderline has been constantly reinforcing and triggering my social anxiety everything is apparently all my fault always apparently everyone whatever that means says i am nuts i am controlling blah blah she tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder there is a laundry list of things that have been said to me it is making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard i try i will never be good enough that maybe i deserve to be alone etc i feel like i am going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend while the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it is not me that i had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement i really do not want to lose her as a friend i just do not know what to do she usually does not listen to me anyways i do not know maybe i am just a dirtbag does anyone have any thoughts as to how to get out of this cycle
0,hi everyone hope you will enjoy my blog i will do the max to share things with you guys n gals i will try to update frequently so visit me tk care
1,i do not want to kill myself i just do not want to exist i do not want to exist i do not want to deal with all these emotions i hate myself i know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone i do not want to kill myself it would just be another giant cost to my family who does not have much money to begin with i am an accident nobody wants a fifth kid in their i was not meant to exist so why am i here if i was not here maybe my parents could have bought a house instead of renting their whole life maybe buy a car that the bumper does not fall off on maybe they could have enough money to retire soon i just wish i did not have to exist to be a burden on everyone
1,hello i am from the uk i have suffered from depression i would say most of my life but have only been on medicines of prozac for just over years on and off i have had times off the medicines and relapsed back into depression and the last time i saw my doctor he said it would be better for me to stay on antidepressants long term the prozac is working for me at the moment however i find the medicines interrupt my sleep and i wake or times a night and the sleep i do get is very light and dreamy sleep plus i seem to be a bit lightheaded and reckless on my motorbike for example i do stupid things like speeding and other dangerous stuff to myself not others which before off the medicines i would never do because i was very paranoid and cautious i was off prozac for a while late last year and things went down hill fast i was cutting my arms and wanted to kill myself i felt i had no reason to live i was drinking to relive the depression and i was drinking about to cans of lageror bottles of wine a night thinking about it i was wrecking my liver and feeling even more depressed in the morning plus i was putting on loads of weight with all the beers which was another reason to make me feel like crap after new year i made the decision with my doctor to go back on the antidepressants and cut the booze almost out i still drink about or a night but that is all because things could not get any worse i feel a lot better i am back in the gym and getting back into shape and my job is going well i am in a recovery stage at the moment i just hope i do not fk it up again like before anyway i hope everybody on here is ok warm regards to you all
1,deleted my facebook about a week ago i decided it was finally time to cut the cord with social media something odd has happened since my depressive episodes have been alot better and actually being more social in school without trying to has anyone else experienced this
0,my little brother was in pain and i did not help him i need to get something off my chest that i have not talked to anyone about before it is about a situation where my mother freaked out over my little brothers bratty behaviour he was about years old and throwing a fit he was in a really bad moment he kicked my leg and all those things were not pretty something must have been bothering him usually he is a very wonderful person funny and smart but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while when he called me a bitch his big sister and i might even have been teasing him my mother totally freaked out she scolded him loudly and he already started crying she went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she would not need it anymore now that he is not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services he stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother i do not want to go to the welfare home that is what it was called to him apparently and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety and my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up it is probably the most painful thing in my life i know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother he is a teenager now but i do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest as i was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally he was so fragile and vulnerable and if i could i would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him until there is no sadness left in him

1,coming to terms with life long depression it is always going to be there in my life like a dark cloud creeping in on a sunny day and i am okay with that after long years of battling depression and going through the highs and lows that come with it and after dedicating myself to therapy medication and lifestyle changes i have finally accepted that i am going to have to learn to live with depression for the rest of my life it is my strength it is my weakness and it makes my life unique
0,so this is the first time i have ever posted something been thinking about a lot lately so this might seem to be pretty random things are changing all around but i do not really think any of it is really going to make much of a difference out with the old in with the new new managers to work with at work new owners to work with at work everything is new at work except for me and what i do show up talk to agents managers publicists local bands local press etc book shows promote shows settle shows it is almost getting to a point where i feel like i am going through the motions i do not get as excited as i used to about bands i am probably just a lit bit jaded but i hate booking shows like w a s p and icp and all that other crap at least by booking these shows i get the resources to book the bands that i like just take the good with the bad about to be an uncle for the first time pretty excited about that but i am kind of scared for my sister i just hope that she and her boyfriend are able to raise the baby together i think it would crush her if he ends up leaving i know that it will all work out in the end but i have a feeling that it might be kind of a rocky road been thinking about life and love a little bit too much lately i really miss what it is like to be in a relationship with someone it is been two years now and i still find myself thinking about the good times i had with colleen from time to time it is not that i miss her i think i just miss the idea of having someone like her to have around it is nice to be able to see someone everyday and not get sick of them someone with whom i can share my thoughts and feelings on a similar note i think it is time that i start taking care of myself a little bit more i know that with my personality i will always want to go out and have a good time in turn i think it is time i get off my ass and start trying to be healthier thinking about giving up meat again we shall see i know that if i manage to lose about lbs my confidence about my appearance will be a lot higher probably would help with the idea of trying to date again

1,i have had borderline personality disorder since i was a little kid although then the therapist said it was bipolar disorder and adhd since then i have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital it is not until now that i self diagnosed myself with bpd i do not even think my doctor really thinks i have that although considering all the research i have done i fit the description perfectly since the age of i was being self destructive by slamming my head in the was during times of stress the first time i starting cutting was when i was this was after an ex boyfriend left me we had only been dating for months sad huh this went on sporadically for about a year and a half during that time i committed myself finally i started dating my next boyfriend he told me if i did not stop cutting he would leave me i stopped we dated years and then broke up i am now and married to another man who is years older than me we have been married almost a year together for years and about months ago i started cutting again this time it is times worse and i cannot seem to stop i am covered in scars and i have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist i am currently on wellbutrin which does seem to be working i do have a lot of good days although since i started to become depressed again i have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son it did not bother me as much just a little before because i did my best to stay busy since i got married i lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone mostly in bed i never had to play mom before so i never thought i would ever be in the position to so i just stayed out of the way plus his son does not like me being around which makes me feel worse in my state of mind i cannot deal with that my alone time is when i cut the most my husband and i are in therapy my therapist wants us to work i am not so sure i can stay with him although i am having a hard time leaving i am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me this puts extra stress on him and i do not want that plus it is my fault i married him i knew he had a kid i guess i did not know i would get bad again last week we talked about me leaving he ran upstairs and cried he said he will fight for me i went straight for the exacto knife i had suicide in mind although i see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself i cut times on the inside of my wrist but i guess not deep enough he came down and found me my antidepressants work almost of the time but whenever i think of losing my husband i get sad and hopeless every time i think of staying with him and feeling the way i do all the time i get sad and hopeless i feel cornered cutting make it all feel better suicide sounds comforting if anyone can relate or has any good advice i am welcome to it

0,ending a friendship am i overreacting i am looking for advice from impartial people to give a little background information i recently went through a nasty split with my fiance of several years my relationship with him up until the dividing issue was solid i have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate that i was only dating him because i pitied him for his looks and that my fiance and i were really just platonic friends but that i agreed to get married out of desperation to be clear none of this is true although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense i did not she was projecting as a result as i have now learned my legitimate relationship became a workplace joke and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year including my bosses this also includes people who i excitedly called after getting engaged and people that i had offered positions in my wedding party to to make things worse the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors not that it matters but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues none of which were in any way related to appearance i feel so betrayed by this friend that i cannot imagine ever reconciling i am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same or if i am overreacting to average workplace drama

1,am i depressed while i have been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen i have never been formally diagnosed with anything because i do not trust the mentalhealth establishment i have only visited a shrink twice once when forced by parents a second time when pressured by a partner because of this i am reluctant to claim i am depressed except in the loose colloquial sense instead i feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires achieve my dreams and so on i hate being alive and would adore a sudden death sure but that does not necessarily mean i am depressed right i do not experience many of the symptoms of formal depression i sleep pretty well most of the time i eat okay and i am socially active i feel abjectly isolated but empirically i spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on i resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problems with me rather than with the world i figure i would be okay if i had the basic level of social success normal folks have a number of close friends and a healthy romanticsexual relationship with one or more partners i am becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible because i yearn for such connections intensely it has only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable i am not depressed my brain have not malfunctioning it has as valid a pattern as any the uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyones i am just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments i find myself in

1,aha moment during therapy so i have been meeting with a therapist about once a week since october of it is been really great and has helped pull me from the brink more than once background i am gay and was raised catholic in the guess what happened next spoiler i was bullied mercilessly if i was not too gay i was too fat or too tall or too weird or too unpopular you get the gist it it was not my hair it was my mannerisms if it was not my high voice it was the dark circles under my eyes gee what could have caused me to be losing sleep flash forward to today my therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself i described what i looked like what characteristics defined me and how i saw myself then i was instructed to as myself as the adult i have become speak to that child and tell him what i was feeling i spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child and told him everything would be alright i told him that all of that hatred was wrong that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things they probably are not even going to remember saying it so do not waste your time holding onto it and it got me thinking about all of the baggage i have he would onto my life all the glances and side comments and nasty hateful things and how i have internalized it and believed it and that is when the aha moment came all this time i have been so worried about all the bullying that other people did i was not even thinking about all the bullying i did to myself all this time it was me sure it was other people who planted those seeds but it was me who perpetuated it who told myself that they were true after all if you say something enough it might as well be as true as anything else so there it is there is one step it might just be one step but it is a step in the right direction there is my holy shit moment of the day and i just wanted to share with you all there is hope there is progress there is love and i hope you all are able to find it

0,my opinion on peoples faith is different i do not think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has and i do not think that other people should judge someone elses faith god is apart of everyones life one way or another mostly everyone knows who god is and the principles behind him i think that the way that people deny christs name so easily is wrong but i am not them so i cannot make their decisions for them but what i can do is i can work my hardest to be a godly example so that they can see what the christian life is all about being a christian is not always fun yes there are always the occansionally disappointment that we run into and from what i have heard alot of people blame god for their mishaps well as hard as this might sound its all apart of gods master plan god allows some misfortunes to happen to test your level of faith that you might have in him but know this god will never test you with more than you can handle beliving in christianity or evolution either one that you believe in requires faith faith believing in something that you cannot see

1,i have always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression but i just told her i am depressed and she responded in the most perfect way i feel really weird i am an adult now and have had crippling depression since childhood growing up i never had emotional support or love i was called names and my mom took out her relationshiplife issues on me i was distant from both my parents i have hugged my mom only once in my life this is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression over the years with distance we started to talk like once a month or so the more educated i became the more i came to understand why she acted the way she did although i still harbor much resentment i am going through a depressive episode just now i feel so alone and i texted her out of desperation i told her i felt alone and depressed and could not get out of bed to study instead of judging me or saying something mean she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms she said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me and she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and i am very important to her she asked if she could do anything to help me and i realized yeah if we could call each other every morning i could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals then i could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day i just feel weird because i do not have a relationship with her i am scared it is going to be awkward but i am desperate for any support i can get right now i also still resent her but at the same time understand i do not know it is just weird but i am happy she acted this way for sure edit i also do not mean to brag or anything like that i just wanted to share this with someone and was wondering if someone had a similar experience maybe in forming a bond with their parents longer into adulthood

1,i was just curious what your feelings are on longterm outcomes for depression a little background for me i have been on and off medicines for several years i was always depressed as a child but did not really seek professional help until maybe years ago i originally went on medicines for severe pms prescribed to me by my obgyn i just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel leveled out then i had issues with sleep apnea joint pains etc my neurologist put me on effexor every time i tried to go off that drug i was dizzy and had bad side effects finally i reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the effexor i had gained a tremendous amount of weight i was off all medicines for months and then i really feel into a dark depression it was then that i sought a therapist etc i have been on medicines ever since since june of i had lost pounds by going off the medicines but then became depressed again following several deaths and major life events i was put on lexapro and gained weight not wanting to gain weight again i hated being on the medicines he kept saying it will stabilize i told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed finally he changed my medicines to wellbutrin we talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down my main reason to go off was the weight gain immediately the weight came back off that was a year ago now a year later i am still losing about a pound or two a month the last time i went in he did not say anything about going off the medicines how long do people take medicines is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole are there any longterm use side effects to be concerned with is this something i will probably be on forever it just seems like i will always be like this it just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows i go for a very long time and feel fine and then i have a week where i get very down and know that if i was not on medicines it would be very bad i have not gone to talk to my therapist in a long while when i am having these bouts of depression should i call and say i need to go in for a checkup i do not really have any specific issues to discuss the big thing right now is i just feel down because i have lost my closest friends and do not feel like i have any friends to do anything with i feel so isolated would it be good to just call and go in i just feel stupid saying i feel sad because i do not have any friends are there any good books that you can recommend on selfhelpesp negative thinking understanding why i think the way i do etc i found dr phils book on life strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why i do things and think

0,ok so boys are a major part of my life so i am going to be posting many blogs about them first if there are guys out there reading this then i want to say that girls in general do not like to make the first move and surely hate to not know how a guys feels i am actually turned on when a guy is able to express himself to me second i want to tell of something that has happened to me in the past i hate it when guys are not able to act themselves if there is something between us how immature is that really then if a guy has a grudge against a girl i cannot stand it how they center their lives around it and try to get back at them by getting on other girls and stuff once again that just proves they are immature and obviously do not know what they are doing so guys learn to make the first move on a girl and get over the akwardness between girls and boys

1,falling back into it i am and this weekend i got into a big argument with my girlfriend of months we had not seen each other in weeks and our plans to see each other fell through i tried to save our plans but she seemed disinterested i was so distraught and caught up in sadness and selfhatred that i wanting to distance myself from the situation not just leaving it alone told her i wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality it turns out i was sadder without her and she reached out to me to talk soon later we got back together and she said she was okay the way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely but i ruined her that day and she is been off ever since she painted her nails black screamed at her parents texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person i was wrote anon is a piece of shit cunt in her bathroom mirror in sharpie and cried all day from the story she told i have fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that i have not experienced since i was a selfloathing nearfriendless grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades watching the few distant friends get reward after reward trophy after trophy i feel like i am a piece of shit that does not deserve to breathe the air on this earth and i do not know what to do my parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive my girlfriend is the only one left who understands me at this point it is just me who has the problem as she is gotten over the whole debacle or so she says her mom even said ehh you two were just stressed out teenagers but i am still not convinced i feel like there is something deeply wrong with me is there any advice or words of wisdom that i need to hear i want to get back to normal i do not know how i will deal with feeling completely alone again and losing the people close to me emotionally

1,maybe they are wrong about it all we are always told when you are depressed your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is what if they are wrong if someone is piss poor and starving cannot pay their bills replace their motheaten clothes or go out to do interesting things surely their money situation really is as bad as all that if someone has no family no friends and has been bulliedabused by everyone they have met in life perhaps their social situation really is as bad as all that if someone has had lots of physical health issues like cancer chronic pain obesity etc maybe their physical woes really are as bad as all that some people go through all of the above all at once so maybe life is as bad as all that for them the whole your brain is lying about how bad things are thing often just feels like you are just imagining your problems like i know depression etc make your brain incapable of dealing with them properly but it does not mean legitimate problems do not exist and that some peoples lives are not thoroughly worthless all the same

1,alright i have been here before to this site and this depressed on life i have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life only to be honest i sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time i was in recovery from a drug problem for years and i developed a relationship with a higher power that really really helped with my depression anxieties addictions so it would be insane for someone who knows the solution to not use it right well i have heard it said before that once someone who had great faith loses it it makes it more difficult for that person to find hope or faith so that is where i have been the past months hopeless i tried heroin after years clean looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression i only got real sick for about the two weeks i was on it and lost a job and apartment then i moved back with my mom who has deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion he is in a halfway house and just lays on her couch all day and my dad has deep depression bipolar on every medication you could think of and lives with his mom who only talks about the divorce and how i should have did this different so really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they are alive but dead in a healthy emotional spiritual mental level so where is the encouragement or love i so long needed as a younger person and even most importantly i need some guidance now instead of being ashamed of who they are i just need to vent i am i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there i feel as though i wear a suit outfit costume of misery fear depression the void so it drives others away plus i am ashamed of being a depressive anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim i mean i am i should be getting laid and having fun right man i feel so old but so immature emotionally i talked to a friend of mine that is at yale in connecticut last night who has always been a good natured smart artistic guy and a person who experiences depression but does not let it get the best of him and he said to not dwell in the negative like i have always done find something through out the day that is positive a girl smiles at you a song whatever man i cannot just turn my mind off from negative thoughts of me and others

0,how hard is this going to be my mom told me last night that she got a diagnosis of stage breast cancer earlier this week from what she says it is noninvassive and not in her lymphnodes two tumors under some of the details are a little bit vague from her apparently the appointment where they gave her the news was imediatlely following a dentist appointment where they pulled two teeth and she had had pain medications so she was a little fuzzy on some details her husband absorbed enough to say the prognosis is good but did not write anything down so i am sorry for the lack of specific details i will know more when i go with her to her surgical consultation next week heres my big question i am the oldest of three my youngest brother has down syndrome and lives with me our middle brother is scheduled to move across the country at the end of may our mom is and has been in intermittently fragile health in the past several years i am a single mom of three kids yrs old last night my brother asked me if he should postpone his move he and his wife have worked really hard to save for this move and it means a lot to them so i encouraged him to follow through with it but the more i think about it the more i worry that our mom is going to need more than i can give alone and that i will not be able to support her the way she is going to need should i ask my brother to stay for awhile more i do not want to fall short for our mom by falling into the old habit of being the family martyr those who have been through treatment for stage one breast cancer or who have been through it with their loved ones how intensive is this going to be and how much help is my mom potentially going to need i am so grateful that this was caught as early as it was i know this could be so much worse but it is still scary as hell so i appreciate any advice

0,was this a true friendship tldr a friend that i have know for years just blocked me on facebook i have always had feelings for her but i had began to move on i do not have a lot of friends and i always liked having her as a friend and as someone i could go to she was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else as she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes i really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married we had talked about marriage a few times in previous years she had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when i asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more she hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship i know that it should not have mattered that she was getting married but i did want to be supportive of it and i also wanted to know because i felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were one day i called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life i called several times but she did not answer because she was busy she finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said i cannot do this then she put severe restrictions on it saying that i could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me i got fed up and told her that it was not true friendship if she would not reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married i also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that i feel towards her then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether i feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me was this ever a true friendship am i wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did is what she did ok from her end was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me i just do not know how to process what happened and i feel bad but i still feel that if i am going to call somebody a friend i should be able to talk to them about life without limitation i do know there are boundaries but just making small talk should not violate a boundary i am just looking for validation i still do care about her as a person i do not think she is evil but i do think that she does not have much compassion for me

0,my friend refuses to pay his dollar lost wager to me what to do long text one day a friend and i started arguing about something it turned into a heated but friendly discussion and eventually we were both fed up with each others differing views so we both proposed a wager we then spent the rest of the day simply arguing but without any real conclusion we decided to actually follow through with our wager before making the wager we agreed on dollars and it was agreed on from both sides fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary i also felt a bit bad about winning so i decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed he said he would have taken the money right then and there i decided i would also then take the money as my friend is or so i thought a man of honor during no time did i ever say i did not want the money from him some time after i won i made a little joke on facebook along the lines of when am i getting my juicy money with a little meme as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me he simply said i invested the money into fucking ethereum of all things he could have done and it rose i probably will not pay you the money i thought this was a joke but later found out he was serious of course this made me mad not only that he would not pay me all of a sudden but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way i then argued with him saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager both knowing what we would get ourselves into i know for a fact that i would have paid him the second i would have lost and i have told him so many times he now claims that it is too much to pay that it does not feel right yet he also feels guilt and that i am being negative and should just move on i get very mad at unjustice just like this as could very well have lost the wager i basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager i have told him i cannot trust him anymore but he seems to just want to move on typing messages on facebook like nothing has changed he said he was sorry but i do not accept the apology as he can still do what is right pay me the money he tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend what is your view on this

1,i need a friend it is hard to put words to my feelings i struggle with sounding serious and not coming off as an obnoxious dick i am sick of people coming and going and i have grown to hate myself i do not ever act like the person i am at heart and i never really have to anyone i want to get out of this shell i have not had friends for years and i have posted here numerous times on alts and my previous account with no reply i would not be surprised if i get overshadowed by someone with much more clearly obvious issues than me like usual but if you care please leave a message i hope you read this
1,a letter to a person i let down to the person i miss the most happy birthday man i miss you and sorry it feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point we used to have so much fun but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse and more often than not leads to poor choices a sweet substance like sugar just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you ever go back to something you once valued so highly been a year and a couple months since talked and rarely a day where you cross my mind not saying healthy because it sure as hell but who cares anyways i good for you you were too good for me we crashed and burned and i loved every second of it was it worth it maybe does that matter not in the slightest now i just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that i know never read pretending in my head that some fucking way that i can salvage the situation like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning when all they have to do is swim to the surface cold and tired wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what doing and i know that doing well that makes me happy you deserve to succeed been to hell and back and i might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it i loved you i think i do anymore but i know i did i thought about comparing how i felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but be honest that our style probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly but you critique me just the way you are too kind and sweet too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that never return the favor and man i really tried to all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness but the past nostalgia is bullshit but i have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something sure you remember that to better times ahead and a letter left unread sincerely your old best friend
1,unstuck yourself i used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point i did not see the point of doing anything nor meaning of life itself one day a light bulb went off i realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time we should not refuse to do things just because we do not understand the point instead we should celebrate the gift we are given just go do things because we can if you are lonely go talk to a homeless person you will be surprised how much you could learn if someone did you wrong at one time forgive them and live for the future life has so much for us to explore the trick is to start on one thing put left foot before right foot then next you will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing

0,i just finished reading g k chestertons the man who was thursday on sunday i think it is possibly among the more thought stirring books i have ever read especially the following lines when i saw him from the back i was convinced he was a devil but when i saw his face i knew he was a god it was one of the more powerful lines of the novel and i will not tell you much more because i do not want to spoil it for those who have not read it yet i think the most amazing books i have ever read outside of the bible have been mainly fiction ones that touched my heart rather than the philosophical ones that expanded my mind it is quite surprising that these novels are so dear to me considering my own overly cerebral nature ravenheart by david gemmel has probably done more for me than ethics by aristotle what kind of books are the ones that have made you change your thinking josh
1,to start off i have had depression quite consistently since i have started college at i am now and my depression was getting pretty bad again then i met this girl about months ago we started dating and it turned out we and tons of similar interests and very similar morals a few days after we started dating she told me that she was going to australia to study abroad for months weeks later she told me she was afraid to lose me i told her we would worry about it when the time comes since then we have had some really great times doing things we both love together yesterday we finally had the discussion of what was going to happen when she left in my mind i was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles i told her i cared about her more than anyone i have ever dated and said that i wish we had a chance together she told me she does not believe in long distance relationships this kind of broke my heart but at the same time i knew it was the logical choice in this situation she told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me she also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us my family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves i am a little worried about myself as well today i cried on the way to school and during my break between classes she leaves in days and she still wants to see me as much as possible before she leaves i am so afraid to lose her and scared of how i will feel when she is gone please help

1,i am year old female i have been on numerous antidepressant and anxiety medicine since i was years old i never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because i had never been in a serious relationship i had never been sexual with someone now that i am in a sexual serious relationship i am having problems i believe this is a result of lexapro i have never had a problem orgasming at least not to this extent and i have been on zoloft prozac you name it etc these medicines were changed because they were either making me too drowsy or simply were not working during the summer i was only on wellbutrin and had no problem orgasming however due to overwhelming anxiety during the start of the school year i started taking lexparo and continued the wellbutrin ever since i added lexapro i have had an extremely delayed orgasm or no orgasm at all it is really frustrating my doctor suggested switching medicine but since lexapro is working so well for me as far as anxiety goes i said i would rather not i cannot lower my dose because i am on the starting dose for both wellbutrin and lexapro he said i could switch to effexor or another ssri medicine but i may have the same sexual dysfunction i was just wondering if anyone here has had a successful combination of wellbutrin plus an anxiety medication that did not because such extreme sexual dysfunction

1,rolling down hill hi all it all started last year when i quit my bachelor in physical therapy that study did not seem right for me and i dropped out in feb from februari till september i have worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college but after that there was not any motivation for anything left over in me this year i started a new study lifesciences it started all fun for the first two months because we had the basics of chemistry anatomy algebra and physics but in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus i had tests from the first semester failed them all in the weeks leading to the tests i could not concentrate or motivate myself to do anything i was just at my room doing absolutely nothing november was my birthday turned everyone forgot it except my gf for years was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last months because i had too little time to see her because i was always busy with school i am feeling that everything is worse my job sucks but i have to keep it as i got to keep up with school costs already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university i just feel that everything that i do fails like the last years i have accomplished nothing i would like to travel if i am going to have my second gap year but my funds would not allow it working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge but there is something good at the horizon there is a small chance i am getting accepted in to the police academy but that is only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse
1,why does it take some months to recover some years and some never i know it is because we all have different brains mental illness affects us all differently i know some illnesses have no cure but i recently saw in a youtube comment section one person said i have been living with depression amp ptsd for years it gets easier every day blah blah blah blah and someone else responded i recovered from depression amp ptsd in about years lmao do those who recover quickly look down on those who recover slowly or cannot recover at all also is there any more information on why we all recover at different rates other than what i mentioned above

1,i definitely think your right that my anxiety has sought out a fear that i dread more than any other and it is true that when i am not feeling depressed which incidentally is most of the time this is only my second spell of depression in years of life i can mull over these thoughts and not be troubled with them in the slightest it is really horrible how anxiety can feed off itself and lead you down this path to terrible thoughts by the way when my partner was pregnant with our first child she to had dreams like yours and she was upset by them and she like you has turned out to be an attentive and first class mother

0,hopefully you have figured out that my theme is william shakespeares as you like it i of course am rosalind the strongwilled independant young woman and orlando is my lover he left this morning and i was trying to find a way to dispense my emotions i thought this would be much more exciting than a journal as i mentioned he left this morning it is the strangest feeling for him to be so distant orlando holds in his chest the other half of my soul i feel empty without him they say absence makes the heart grow fonder i hope this is just a little bump in the cobblestone street we have been together for years most couples are married by that time but our ages keep us waiting we are still young and must establish our careers first i have small doubt that our love will fail i just hope my orlando will not be tempted by an eve to eat or whatever else a forbidden fruit if the fruit is consumed i will be left with no other choice but to close the gates of eden not matter the pain but once again i have small doubt our love is strong and shall brave the elements i love orlando as he does me but true is it that we have seen better days william shakespeare as you like it

0,i suppose i should have a little more content to justify the massive pagelengthening links list at right okay it is not that massive but it is longer than the lone post i have not been thinking about much lately just doing whatever to get through the day i have not been sleeping too well either for some reason i sleep through the night but i wake up just as exhausted as the night before this weekend was nice i slept quite a bit and lazed around at home stressfree mom and grandma are visiting grandpa in grand rapids so i am just hanging out online for a few more hours i should make a shopping list and maybe take grandpas van to go shopping i would rather wait and go with matt but he has to mow the lawn and take care of the trash after he is done with his class and grandpa just called and said he is got a prescription to be picked up at the pharmacy before so i might as well go by myself thinking about this coming school year too i am so anxious to be done i just want to get matts grad school stuff taken care of and move on with our life i have one theory class to complete a communications minor but it is now cancelled for the fall semester which means it will be offered during the winter semester if i take it then it will be alongside the theory class i need for my literature major and that would make my brain implode again so maybe that was just decided for me as things stand this fall i am taking world novels lit western civilization to history beginning latin french and a morning volleyball class for an even credits i probably could have handled the theory class this fall or dropped either western civ or latin and volleyball but we will see if it is still cancelled by midaugust i also need to apply for graduation but my advisor is out of town this summer so we will wait until the fall semester has started it is freezing cold in this house i wish i would brought a jacket or a sweatshirt i suppose i could drive home and get either but meh i will survive

1,reluctant to get diagnosed i am reluctant to go to the doctor and find out if i have depression i cannot exactly explain this but it is a combination of a few things part of me feels that i am asking to be depressed and another part of me fears that i do not have depression and my problems are all just my own fault
0,ahhh so after a talk with a friend and a weekend in the country i am much calmer saturday was absolutely wonderful jb and i went to a farmers market went swimming then fell asleep on the grass in the shade the relaxation was much needed and i feel soo great oh we went shopping on friday and i spent way too much money i got some supper cute heels though i have always been into girlie things i love pink but this season is making it sooo much easier to be into pink i love it i bought little pink heels with wonderful tiny black bows on the side i also bought a bunch of work clothes i am soo happy
1,now i know we are all on the same bus but i am an engineer who works with nerds all day these people are social misfits not like i am not but i can sit in my hamster cage all day and one will talk to me they really do not talk to each other unless it is either work related or they are talking about themselves it is like working with robots and they are good at it i am really thinking i hate geeks but i am one as well but who knows where that takes me can anyone tell me how this is a healthy atmosphere for any of us is it common if i leave and get another geek job will it likely be the same
0,should i be upset with my best friend my best friend of over years recently took her first trip to new york city i was so excited for her and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when i was there were i knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift when i gave her the gift she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she did not go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up i know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering which is why i feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful i also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she did not go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened i want to know what other peoples thoughts on this are before i talk to her and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me

1,i have so much to say and do not know where to start let us see i am in a relationship with a man who is not the same guy i met before he was so caring and always wanted to give me affection now all he can seem to do is drink and constantly want to fight he has become to the point where everything i do is monitored he checks my cell phone to see who has called checks my emails to see who wrote calls me a day to see what i am doing will not allow me to go over to my friends house who i have known for almost years without him being there and checks the history on the computer to see what web sites i visited now i have never cheated on him and i always find wrong in what he is doing some days i just wish he would leave but other days all i seem to hope is that he will change every one of my friends thinks that he should go since he is getting physical but he is my security i do not work and i can stay home with my month old baby he provides for us and the baby is not his if he goes how do i do it if he stays will he change i have tried to talk to him but all he says is that i am never happy i need to grow up and stop acting like a kid i want to smile again i do not want to be controlled but i want him someone please help i do ask mom for a lot of help but i do not think that is too kid like i can be a b word but only if i am mad about something he will not help me on i want a day to myself a night to go out with friends but he will not watch my son even though i watch his year old every day days a week so that he can provide for our family sorry i could go on forever but i think that you get the point by the way i am a year old in case you are wondering will you help me please
1,women ignore me even here they think i am unworthy or too ugly to be helped i even have the stats to prove it why am i so undeserving of love i made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why i am undatable and why no women wants to go out with me i got views and only comments only of which was from a woman everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me heres proof so if women viewed my profile only one person tried to say something everyone else ignored me women think i am ugly or not worthy of a relationship think about that that is how unwanted i am what if every minutes someone told you you are ugly no one wants you no one cares for you and you will die forever alone that is the life i might as well live in let us not also forget the people that made fun of me too i mean what do you want me to do to get your replies ladies do you want me to give you gold will that incentivize you to reply the sidebar says a supportive space for anyone struggling with depression and yet people make fun of me do not want to help and call me ugly i guess i am that hopeless am i really a human anymore it is human to fall in love and get into relationships and have sex and whatnot with your so it is human to even hookup with people i am not qualified to be a human apparently i bet most people my age have had so as and i have had a big fat even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships when other people see them their mental illness makes them want to care for them but for me they run away it is apparent in this subreddit too not even worthy of being spoken to from a woman

1,no matter how much progress i make i always fall right back down to rock bottom all my friends have forgotten about me and no one supports my art writing and music i cannot find bandmates and all i can see myself doing in the future is music but my talent is mediocre at best i do not know what else to do with my future and i only see dark days ahead i fell in love with an exchange student who is now my boyfriend but now he is back in his home country and i do not have the money to visit him and he has strict parents who will only pay for him to visit me once a year i am sick of baggage from my childhood and teen years weighing me down and all this is just adding to it
1,i do not understand how people can be so interested in so many things first let me apologize for formatting issues i am typing this on mobile i generally find television boring have little to no interest in netflix shows anime and most video games and hobbies i really only have one hobby that i have feel attachment to and frankly i do not enjoy most new shows if i watch something of my own its typically something i watched from when i was younger like scooby doo or phineas and ferb as the two main ones being my absolute favorites from my youth though that is rare as it is and whenever i do those things except for my one main hobby sometimes i feel that i am all to aware that it is just escapism and instead of escaping i fall back into the same track i do not think i have a short attention span but that is what i always feel like i go back to in the back of my head as that is what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age
0,august my thoughts are filled with just getting out leaving everything behind maybe i am a walking contradiction there is no other way for me but to lead here i am now leading the pressure is getting too much sometimes i feel like this is not me anymore i hate some stuff i am obliged to do smile here smile there give commendations be a people person i fucking hate all these crap there are times i want to be left alone i want to have some quiet time i want to do my thing in spite of myself i realized all i want to have is a low profile life a quiet life maybe that is why i was not too keen on modelling people are so nosy and i could not just smile when asked to i just want to do my thing i want to sleep when i want to i want to wake up no matter how late i want to dress up the way i want to i hate ties i hate looking so yuppy i want to curse whenever i feel like it i will be friendly when i want to i will be nice when i feel like being nice show me the light please as i am about to go nuts where i am now
1,there is a big chance that i will become a millionaire in a year or i got involved in bitcoin years ago bought a lot when it was dollars and based on my bitcoin increasing from trading altcoins and the increasing value in general i believe i can seriously become a millionaire in a year or i am depressed though i want to figure out how i can reinvest that money not for the purpose to make more but how i can make other aspects of my life better i would really like to hear what people think and also i do not really know how to feel about this i think it is important to be humble and i never want that to change about me but i am going to become very wealthy i have a certain perspective on money money is not evil it is a resource it is power you can use it for good or bad i want to become a billionaire you can save and dramatically change of peoples of lives with that amount of money i would rather have that power than someone who does not have that perspective does this make sense i just feel this way about money i feel like people think it is evil and pursuing money is evil but you can do good things with money and i want to do that how should i feel and think about this what do you think i am going to have money and power but i do not know how to use it to help myself
0,frustrated with the early process of my breast lump i am and keep telling myself there is no way i can have breast cancer but so many of you are so young that i feel i may be misguided about the likelihood of getting breast cancer before my gyno noticed a breast lump on my left breast during my annual appointment last week i had a mamo and ultra sound earlier today i have a grape sized lump on my left breast on the inside of my breast it is solid and it does not move or hurt from my research all of this is bad news i have a consultation with a boob dr scheduled for thursday they require the consultation before they do the biopsy which is frustrating i really just want to get to the point and know if it is cancer or not i do not really know why i am writing this or what i want from this post but any thoughts advice or banter is welcome
0,sister in law who opted for naturopathic remedies instead of chemo now has advanced stage i am absolutely furious at these vancouver practitioners she is been giving them thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars and is now at the point where she is missing actual appointments because her back pain is so severe my wife is currently taking care of her and has been telling me some of the treatments they are selling her and when i look them up every one of them is dubious at best but primarily they are utter horseshit a short incomplete list photon sound wave allegedly to devitalize and get her cells all on the same frequency vitamin drips they take hours and cost thousands hyperbaric treatments putting her in a pressurized chamber various herbs and spices dietary restrictions and supplements they started a gofundme yesterday which has amazingly already collected more than because she is such a well loved beautiful person i am afraid a large part of this money will end up in the hands of these snake oil salesmen when they find out about it i do not know what to do but i had to leave this somewhere its possible they did not do any real harm but they told her they have cured cases like hers and i am afraid they might have caused her to allow the window for real treatment read actual medicine to close as the last time she saw a real doctor they told her chemo is no longer an option when before it was we will not do surgery until you have done chemo i am so angry i am in tears is there no legislation in place to protect vulnerable patients from salesmen like this the products they sell should require a disclaimer stating this product will not cure cancer i know some people find emotional comfort in these alternative treatments some of them might have an effect placebos can be very powerful etc so i do not want to offend anybody please just someone say something thank you

1,it is been a while since i have written and i decided to start off again with a bit of a bang i am going to post my story of beginning recovery this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too well now where to start about a year and a half ago the beginning of grade is when i started to notice the changes not physical but emotional i had been told many times that this was very normal for teenagers so i thought nothing of it there was an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man who i just happened to have an enormous crush on anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened than he meet this girl at a hockey game he immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much i began to feel more and more useless after that i started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese and by march of that year i was quite close to suicide at several occasions this is when i started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many selfhelp methods all of which failed i thought grade could be a new beginning it was not my grades were starting to slip and i just could not be happy anymore finally after a close call in december i told my mum all about my failed attempts and how i was feeling she agreed to get me a new doctor i visited her and i got diagnosed with depression and was prescribed cipralex of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school falling really far behind and having several more close calls finally i started feeling a little better and was even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the east well i just got back from that trip and i have never felt better i am ready to face the world that trip was just what i needed when i get through these next weeks until my birthday all i can see is a varely clear path ahead for the first time in a year and a half i can concentrate and tolerate less than perfect circumstances i hope everyone here will feel this way you can if you just push through power to us rock on
1,i have had quite a few life situations that have probably contributed to depression i grew up in an emotionallysexually abusive family but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head to make you wonder if it was really abusive or if you were just sensitive i still talk to them and see them at times but vast quantities of things go unsaid i left home for college and almost immediately was recruited into a religious cult where i stayed for or so years i just got out a couple of years ago i had my first major depressive episode while inside and although i found a supportive therapist she too was in the cult and therefore some of her advice at times was influenced by their beliefs also i was alternately shunned and ostracized rebuked harshly or encouraged to give up medicinestherapy by various members in various levels of leadership in the cult i very recently switched jobs to a much better job situation but am still adjusting the environment we are in contract to purchase a home which is great but also an adjustment the question my psychiatrist thinks i have been depressed for most of my life which makes sense when i look back over my journals and look at various things i did said or experience thing is to me depression as a state of mind became normal i did not know anything different than how i was feeling so what happens is this i mention something i have been experiencing to my therapist she is concerned and asks if i have brought it up to my psychiatrist when i do bring it up to my psychiatrist he says why did not you mention this before to which my response is i did not know i should translation i thought it was normal right now i am on effexor with adderall xr as a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium when i started i was okay great even minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day lately though i have been feeling things that i cannot describe sadness but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word sadness can contain tired but a tired with an emotional component feelings i do not have words for but that pierce me to the bone and that are not connected with anything in real time that i can think of is this normal deep strong feelings that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate usually on the weekends when i do not have work to focus on not feeling much of anything in between those times being vibrant and full of ideas yet calm and productive first thing after i take the medicines but gradually fading to sort of numb definitely tired somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted sink into the couch with the remote hit the bed for a nap by sometimes how do you know what is normal if abnormal has been normal for you for so long how do you know when it is time to have a sit down with the psychiatrist again

1,i have been so depressed over a lost friendship i have known this girl for about years we were very close or so i thought we both had boys around the same age went on vacations together with our families and both went through our pregnancy together i knew she was a person that had to have things her way but i accepted this she has a large circle of friends that she included me in i felt her family was mine in a way i am very shy and came out of my shell last year i got caught up with other friends that were having problems they really needed me so i was not around much but i am always available if she needed me anyway we got into a misunderstanding over something very minor i really did not think much about it the next day that is the way i am i get mad then i am over it within hours she is not like that she holds grudges i saw her the next day of july at her house i knew she did not really talk to me but she did have a lot of people there well a couple of weeks after i call her saying hey girl can i pick land on up she said how can you call and act like nothing is wrong then she hangs up on me i wait until the next day and called again first thing she says is what do you want i say just to be your friend she says we are no longer friends there will be no more double dating with our husbands vacations you are to not come to my house we are not friends i was blown away i asked what i did and she could not give me a direct answer she said we had different friends and i had more drama than any of her friends of years i asked her what drama last year i had some problems with my husband but i did not really talk to her about that she said that was a problem i did not tell her things and that is what friends do what she was contradicting herself she hung up on me again it is very difficult for me because when i make a friend and let them into my heart they are my friend for life her son is my sons best friend and her husband is my husbands best friend i had recently told my husband to not mention their names around me because i become really depressed my poor son does not understand why she does not like me anymore how can i explain when i do not know i bought her daughter a shirt about a month ago and she did not acknowledge it until she saw me in walmart a week later and we were face to face and she thanked me it was very weird i have not seen her since july i cannot let my son have his friend over anymore because it hurts too much to see him and know that i am not welcomed in their home and they have not asked my son over their house since all of this even though he still came over ours i cannot figure out what i did that was so bad i wish i knew so that maybe i could at least defend myself and have some closure
1,do you feel like this sometimes i have to make essays for tomorrow but all i can do is lie in bed all day and cry myself to sleep
0,i have not written any diaries or any other sort of it for a long time not since my last relationship was over a year ago but the pain and hurt and unsecurity i feel right now are just too much for me it is been overloading and ready to explode i need to let it out somehow i just cannot let it out to the person that actually needs to hear it most i do not understand why i am always in this kind of relationship over and over again why am i always with a man that has no future it is always no hopeno riskno commitment i do not choose whom i fall in love with but it is always men like them the man i am with now is the perfect example of my stupidity he is younger than me we have nothing in common he is too goodlooking and not ready for a serious relationship i knew that from the very beginning but somehow i still let myself to fall in love with him why the hell would i do that does not my brain tell my heart what to do is there no connection at all between them i have trying to give this man everything i thought somehow i would melt his heart and make him fall in love with me oh i sound so pathetic now but now after months together nothing has changed he is still and will never be the man i want him to be he make me feel so unsecure especially when it comes to other women i am a jealous girl he knows that and it does not stop him to get in touch with hix exs keep their pictures in his laptop looking at other girls when he is with me cooking for other girls and invite them to come over if he already has me why would he do that right and what the hell am i doing with him until months i cannot walk away from him i wish he copuld change someday somehow i do not understand why he is doing this to me does he realize how much he hurt me i do not know why i am typing this i should be talking to him no and break up with him it would be so much easier if there is no love i do not want to lose him but it is killing me everyday from all the pain he because me the answer to my problem is so clear why cannot i just take it what is wrong with me

1,tomorrow the world will go on like always i have never been here this was not a part of the plan but i said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything i have lived years by myself no relationships no close friends and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out i run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence no one knows who i am and even if presented with a companion i do not know if i could ever explain the scars i hate who i am and how i act i feel though it is not even me social anxiety makes me act in ways i cannot even understand and the repetition of i am okay is getting old i have tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it is left me feeling like a sociopath insanity overcomes me as i scream clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind i have tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but i cannot handle this anymore the need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak i am i strive for perfection but am the opposite of it i have so much love that i want to express but have no place to put it i was raised religious but have so many doubts my problem maybe is not ignorance but overthinking i hope nobody seems to understand subjectivityrelativity there is much to be said but this will probably find its own void i am dreaming of a different world but the oblivion of what i do not know plagues me i leave my love and peace here may you find yours because this is how things ought to have been and i know the worst of it was not all that it seemed why cannot i dream do i care to dream

1,i know i am depressed but i have no energy to do anything to counter it i have been searching for a job for months to no avail i used to have an office job for years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country and from the second month onward i have plunged deeper and deeper into depression back then in uni days i was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications i have been off them since my graduation because i did not want to depend on them for the rest of my life and i did not really have the funds to continue the treatment back then these days i feel exactly like i am slogging through those low energy periods again my mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until or of the clock in the morning my biological clock is a total mess in the morning i would just sleep in and refuse to wake up even though it is already past noon i tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible i just plainly do not want to meet anyone it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable i even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application i know that i am in a big mess i disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything but then when i am faced with the colossal task at hand i would chicken out then i would sleep on it hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic nothing has changed and i am still deep in depression

1,fix anything in my life such a fundamentally broken person want to say been fighting for years but not true all i can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over no action i take to improve myself can ever have weight because so godddamn broken that when i try to do something to better myself it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser i am i cannot handle the fucking pain that comes with self improvement not fun in the least humbling too humbling and it just shoves in my face all the time wasted and all of the experiences i never had simply by virtue of being my self everyone happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence like things just happened to them and fell into place this be further from the truth of my experience nothing ever just happens organically either i try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence or i do anything at all hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection never had interests or goals or relationships or friends i never will these thing just happen you have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen i am not that person i will never be that person because i even know who i want to be and if i figured that out i would be too insecure to become that all i see in my future is homelessness and destitution because i came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests special memories or relevanthelpful past experiences my memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point if i ever did have those things they have long been gone to the abyss i just think why why do i have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else not even a real person a complete shell of what could have been a person this is too difficult to come to terms with while impossible to argue against it is true it is my reality it honestly just makes me angry bitter and jealous of others at a very deep fundamental human level for what the healthy people have i fantasize about taking two and unloading on people maybe i know them maybe i it matter often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough not as the result of an but of the fact that i am who i am both physically and psychologically blind rage that is what the result of my dysfunction is pure fucking anger at both the world and myself unable to cope with my grim reality all i want to do is destroy the only thing i could ever really destroy is myself the thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as i see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be just like it always has i handle the responsibility of being alive and i want to anymore just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers until either i or something else kills me

1,the one upside of being depressed i have recently noticed something that has strangely enough somehow helped me a bit with my depression see i have started not sweating the small stuff for example stuck in traffic it is okay spilled my coffee oh well my coworker is annoying does not phase me my thought process is like this when i wake up and feel like dying at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head since i came to realise this i have noticed an increase in my general mood or at least i have become better at coping with going outside shopping etc
1,feel like i have no right to feel this way people have it worse than me while i a privileged man with a loving family cannot feel most of the time i hate using the term even as writing this i feel like i want to delete it being thrown around so much lately that i feel like just being a little bitch that uses it like i know it have been seeing therapists for months talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently thankfully not prescribed any of those fucking pills because my current therapist is smart enough to know they the best medicine for me whenever i feel joy it lasts for a minute then back in my own dark world very dark world i think about suicide screaming at people wanting to beat some people up then i lay down and feel guilty for thinking about such horrible thoughts sorry for the rant today was a shitty day and i had to let it out somehow
1,sub for high functioning depression title this sub is okay but i feel like it is a lot of teenagers starting to learn how to cope with the disease or straight up despair posts i am looking for more discussion than venting

0,a letter of complain dear ms tang i really must have to complain about the summer camp that organized by your company i was one of the first students from my school to go to this camp expecting a relaxing camp the camp was totally a disaster there were many problems in the camp such as there were holes on the tents all the sport equipment was broken foods were horrible and a very dirty beach on the first night of the camp it rained so we decided to stay in the tent to play some card games however there were holes on the tents the rain dropped through the holes and made us all wet also it made us unable to sleep and even so some of my classmates had caught a cough after that night finally the rain had stopped on the next day therefore we all got out and wanted to enjoy some sports activities when we got to the sport equitmenp room we found that all the things were broken we could not play football because the football had a hole and so do the basketball we also could not play the tennis because we could not find the tennis ball all the things there were like a mass and made the room just like a rubbish room at that day we did nothing until noon and all of us were bored hoping for a delicious lunch the food was awful the food was badly cooked for example the fish had bad smell and seemed that it had been cooked a long time ago the soup was the most horrible dish the color of the soup was black we did not want to eat them but we were all hungery and there were no restaurants nearby we had to eat them in the afternoon many of us felt sick and had a stomachache the advertisement of this camp said that there would be a beautiful beach near the camp site for us to swim however the beach was terrible too the beach was full of cans glass bottles paper and so do the see we all disappointed about the camp and we all thought that this was the worst camp that we even had i was totally not satisfied by the services that provided by your company and we are claiming the total cost that we spent on the camp which is totally five thousands six hundred dollars if you do not give us the refund we will take further action by sending complain to the consumer council i am looking forward to receiving your prompt reply yours faithfully k ng k ng

0,apparently i just found out that my family lied to me i am named after chocolate also i just learned that you can extrapolate a person info from a crosssection of data even if you are anonymous medical data social media data etc so if i had not seen so many posts about not going to say it i would have thought that google can read my mind me pressing enter before i set off a bomb somewhere else when a wave crashes and an ant crawls over a cats toe that is about to pounce on a butterfly that it thought was a bee

1,i went to this meeting it was for people who have depression the leader said to me that i was so knowledgeable i should be well i was very sick at the time which went to show me i had knowledge but no wisdom for years i knew this i read all the books and nothing changed i really felt like maybe i was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression yet i did feel better i thought my life is not changing though i have so many hopes and dreams for my life and here i am sitting around wasting it i still feel like that at times but then something bad happened and i did not react to it i did not feel worse then someone did something stupid and i did not yell at them i went to a friend and asked if she thought i was getting better her answer was hell yeah you bother to talk to me now it seems she was doing all the talking at one stage i did not know it is been years since i first got depressed in all the tests on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day i got mild depression ok today its back to moderate i think the reason for this is that i am nearly there with a thought process and i just cannot get it i am kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those words from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better do i need to go back and do some stuff on self esteem again is this what this is about i look inside of me and see my self esteem has fallen apart again and i mean again how many times is this a times why cannot i work this out i do not know what is wrong i think if she asked me now i would tell her i have not got all the answers yet somehow i wished she was right that with what i knew i could just be better i am off to hit the books is not depression ironic you can feel bad about anything even a compliment by the way i am still procrastinating it is better though i think not that much though i have so much to do ok that is wrong is not it i am heading to the quiet of my bedroom to study i hope

1,i have basically been living a lie for the last year my depression social anxiety has become so crippling that i am scared to work outside of the home but i told my parents that i was working anyway because i did not want them to know how bad it was i was not taking money from them or anything i do not live with my parents and my husband has a great job and i do not technically have to work but now that i have come clean about it my mother says she feels manipulated i guess i can see why and i do feel really bad about lying to them i suppose that their forgiveness will just take time but the thing is i cannot tell any of them how bad this really is including my husband it is to the point now where i am even afraid to see a doctor i am sure there is not some magic formula for getting past actually having to admit that you have a really serious problem but i was just wondering how some of you were able to get past that feeling of embarrassment and shame that keeps you from getting help and telling the people you love the truth every day is getting harder and harder especially now that my family knows i have been lying i really thought telling them would make everything a little easier lying instant paranoia but now i cannot stop thinking about how i have ruined my relationships with them forever and i am even more hopeless than i was before how can i get past this embarrassment

0,where does one start i guess by telling a bit about who i am where i have been and where i hope to go i live in northern california in a little community called yankee hill we are situated between the towns cities of chico and oroville about miles north of sacramento i live on beautiful acres where i bring dogs i rescue from the pound no sweet sounding titles like animal shelter here and train them to work with people with disabilities one february of we placed our programs first service dog to work with a young girl with cerebral palsy it was a really exciting event and after following up on them for the past months they are doing really great i am now working with other dogs one is being trained to work as a the ears for a hardofhearing person who also seems to be picking up the tasks needed to assist someone in a wheelchair her name is polly and we believe that she is a mix of german shepherd and yellow lab starr is a black lab mix and she is being trained to assist someone with a wheelchair her progress seems to be slower but i am still hoping that she will pass the program if not we will find her a good home as a pet or possibly keep her to be our demonstration dog the only real problem with her is that she is not real confident in big city environments she is about months old so there is still time to help her overcome her issues then we have mocha a chocolate lab we chose her for a specific client who has a spinal condition that is making it progressively harder for him to walk on his own mocha is being trained to wear a harness with a handle that he can hang onto and offer him balance and stability we have only been working with her for a couple months she also has had some issues for us to help resolve the most major is a fear of having either her ears or tail touched as if she was picked up by them at some time the other is that she has had a hard time staying in one place when someone moves near her both of these things are being addressed and we are having great success with her developing more confidence in a variety of situations well that is a start i will stop here and see how this looks and pick it up again later this evening ta ta

0,i was at a wedding in nh this past weekend and i cannot help but wonder how many more weddings i will attend before i myself get married i am not dating anyone currently but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire not that i am opposed to it in fact when i was in my last major relationship i was pushing for it myself but why did i think he was the one well it did cross my mind but i just saw him for the first time since we broke up on sunday after the sat wedding and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now does it make sense to get married when you do not know what you yourself want out of life i am starting to realize that the answer to that last question is no so i do not think i am going to go looking for a husband any time soon since i need to figure out my own path first but i must say it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be that must be a girl thing though

0,unreturned texts an old college dorm friend who started organizing reunions i saw twice last year with other former classmates has not responded to my last two texts including a holiday greeting to him and his family which i consider rude i made it a point to keep in touch with people especially during the holidays am tempted to zap this person and drop him but my wife says to let it slide i would not say we are close but am perplexed at the rudeness of not even mustering a reply to a holiday greeting even if its fake i have done nothing to this person except it came out during our last group get together that i went on to get a law degree at an elite school i never even discuss careers or money at these things if that is the reason baffling
0,first mammogram six benign tumors should i be worried i am years old and i went to the obgyn for a yearly exam and included with this was the first mammogram i have ever had when you turn you are supposed to get your first mammogram but i skipped my yearly pap smear last year so i did not get a mammogram either i did not go because i did not want to i hate going to the doctors office they always take your blood pressure and mine is always high at the doctors office because i hate going to any kind of doctor for any reason anyway after that i got a phone call from the office and they had scheduled an appointment for me at a different office for additional testing the reason given was that i had dense tissue and no prior mammograms to compare to and i should go in and have additional screenings so i was not too phased by that and i went to that appointment without any fear so i found out that i have six tumors i had to sign a form that stated that i had tumors that were probably not cancerous but i should go back in six months for more tests the person who reviewed my images said that the tumors i had appeared to be benign and of the sort that never metastasize i was also told that they had seen a patient who had of similar looking tumors and they were very reassuring but i am going back in six months my aunt had breast cancer and she went through a double masectomy and chemotherapy and was cleared of her breast cancer but within a year she had pancreatic cancer and that killed her my coworker had breast cancer and she got a masectomy and chemotherapy and was cleared to go back to work but then she was diagnosed with leukemia had a bone marrow transplant that was reported to be successful but then she took a sudden turn for the worse and died she died bald with a swollen head because her hair never grew back so just curious should i be worried about six benign tumors

1,i checked myself in to a mental hospital i decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that i should go to a mental hospital i say annoying because i was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself while i wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues i was also afraid of going somewhere unknown i went through with it despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there to get my life turned around i feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals in reality if you need the help please seek it out you may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they do not remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs my experience was a pleasant one overall i went there and focused on fixing my issues and i would say i came out feeling better i am not sure if i can or should give the name of the place but i am sure someone can let me know down below i just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one the place was pretty clean an adult area for people and over rooms and halls split by gender bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished you had a good amount of personal time to do whatever outdoor activities were available permitting the weather the place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who is still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive the food was surprisingly delicious and great honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic vegetarian or needing gluten free food there were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything the treatment team could have been better they were good to me but not to everyone there changed meds without informing me i went from to to of abilify good lord i felt it once i was home then really felt it when they made a mistake and i went cold turkey for two weeks because i could not get my prescription filled i will update once i am properly back on it so that is my experience after a week i came out feeling better i got off of wellbutrin after determining it could be the because of my increased depression the abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day i feel better than when i went in i know this is a long post however i have been afraid of sharing my experience with others i do not want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went so here i am with this post if this is also posted in the wrong place please let me know and i will gladly move it to the right subreddit
0,okay if i wrote about my situations wmy ex i would have a huge fucking post so i have decided not to write about boys at all it is been fuckin madness so um uh let us see it is friday yay this weekend is the apalachin firemans field days tonight i will be taking my daughter to watch the fireworks tomorrow i will be taking her to my aunts to watch the parade go up the street and go to the field days to ride rides and stuff that is exciting yesterday i went to one of those adult bookstores all by myself how creepy it was like me and hairy greasy icky men i bought a lovely blue personal massager wa dolphin on it to give my clitoris the special attention that it deserves i took it up to the guy to pay for it and he was like i have to test it so of course i giggled bc i thought he was joking it turns out he was serious i guess they have a no refund no return policy which makes sense so he had to take it out of the box and put batteries in it and make sure it worked and it did not so i had to go get another one it was very awkward but the guy was really cool about it other than that i guess i have no news ta ta
1,the moment of clarity i have had suicidal ideations for as long as i can remember despite this i always wrote off my depression as not being a problem throughout my entire lifetime my thoughts have been so warped that i just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience it sounds so stupid typing things out the moment i realized that my mental illness was real was coming to the conclusion that welladjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis and with that came my wake up call to get help
1,new to this site i was diagnosed with sle lupus about eight months ago and i am on very strong treatment using predinsone everyone around me noticed it first i guess since i was suddenly so quiet moody and would cry at the drop of a hat which was so unlikely of me i used to crack jokes laugh and my goal was always to have fun and make others laugh but since my diagnosis and medications which i counted and i am taking like almost pills a week and i just turned yesterday honestly i would never thought i would be in this state at a few years ago anyway i never wanted to admit it depression is not only a symptom of lupus but it is a side effect of the medication as well and i think that it is a general first reaction to being told that you have an incurable disease but i finally am starting to see it now i think that i am really depressed i was never a quiet girl but now i am so quiet that i think i am scaring everyone but now i am living with my wonderful boyfriend who seems to understand everything so well and is so patient with me but i just need a place where i can talk this out with people who understand

0,how do i get my best friend back last year me and one of my best friend decided to get into a relationship it lasted a couple of months and she got disturbed due to some personal problems and i made a mistake of not giving her space as obviously i was worried as a boyfriend and also the best friend because she will not share what happened to her and truly it was something bad we both had an amazing friendship of years before that and there may not have been a single day that went by without talking to each other its like she became an integral part of my life but after she started to distance herself from the relationship i did keep bothering her which was a mistake on my part and i did apologize to her for that she kept blocking and unblocking me since then and i tried my best to get back our friendship as it matters to me more than a relationship as out of the few people who truly know me and are as important as the organs of my body she is one of them and as we know even without one organ a person feels handicapped as i do now yes it might be selfish of me as i am the only one who wants the friendship to be like before all of my attempts have failed so far but its next to impossible to not think of her as she was my routine for past years and i too tried the regular methods suggested everywhere like cutting contact getting busy etc but at the end of the day you always have some time for yourself and in that time her thoughts always come to my mind
1,my parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time because if i try and fail its worse because expected to succeed i even understand why they expect me to be the successful one i barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when i just took easy courses i failed english and nearly failed spanish in grade because i was too lazy to put in any effort i barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school but for some reason their grand vision for going to make the family proud
1,does anyone care i have friend but i physically seen them in years but we facetime and talk every single day until recently no big deal pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life i know people who i used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences we talk at all but follow each other on social media but the thing when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you even get a text asking if okay does that mean no one cares i see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if okay i mean i expect them to but i know when i see people that i care about talking like that i need to make sure that okay i mean how can you say friends with someone but not even say anything when threatening to kill the selves weird be sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything but make sure to send you a picture on snapchat to keep the streak lol worthy enough for a number on snapchat but not worthy enough to live in their eyes sorry for the rant just wondering if anyone is expierencing this or idk
0,question about breast cancer staging tldr what stage is a tnm of with a multifocal idc size of and grade with dcis of grade and two lymph nodes involved my mom had a lumpectomy about two weeks ago for breast cancer and recently received the final biopsy and staging results the paper the surgeon gave her states that the tmn is and i am extremely confused as too what the actual number stage of the cancer is since when looking online gives different results for what these numbers mean to give a little more information the tumor was mutlifocal idc with one area being and the other one was with a large area of grade inbetween the tumors themselves one lymph node had been heavily spread to and the second had only a small amount of cancer cells the third lymph node did not have any cancer cells she is triple positive for e and i am confused on the actual staging because for instance looking on the susan g komen table in the area checking both and because i am not really sure which one i should be following and the triple positive areas the table shows stage the most interesting thing i have found when researching staging is the second example on this site says that cancer that is a larger size and with more lymph nodes then what my mom biopsy showed is still but like this one and other places says the staging is stage my dad asked what the stage was but i think he kind of asked a leading question that because lymph nodes were involved that made it stage and i am sure that the surgeon see a lot of people not to how many did the surgeon see before my moms appointment and could have possibly gotten confused about things has anyone else know someone with a similar diagnosis and can let me know what the stage is i would like to know because i know the treatment between stage and is very different and i would hate to see my mom go through treatment that was not necessary thank you for reading

0,i was recently watching one of my favourite movies the wizard of oz and i realized that you can only move on if you learn that dreams do not necesseraly come true that pain do not necesseraly pass by and that you have to lock your dreams and your hopes somewhere deep in your soul it is hard to find out that you will not be necesseray happy you will not find someone who loves you the way you love him but it does not matter you learn to come along you learn to get tougher and tougher i am afraid afraid of waking me up one day and find out that i am feeling anything i prefer to suffer because it means i am alive

1,i could use some support right now yesterday my best friend of five years attempted to kill their self i am currently being blown away by school grad school if it really matters i do not know what to think at all this is midterm week and most my profs are understanding but the one class i am worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark i get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but i need the feedback to decide if i am going to even stay in the course because it is incredibly difficult it just feels like nothing is going my way currently and it is so hard to study or focus side note another prof let me write as told them like i did the other that i wanted it as a distraction and said that if i did bad they would shift the weight to my final
0,i just got back from seeing the movie i robot starring will smith let us just say i was just a tidge disappointed in the movie first of all when i heard that this movie was coming out i picked up the book not the misleading one with will smith on the cover i was fascinated by the book in the fact that it was a series of vignettes about the evolution of robots from mindless machines to a species equal to ours all shown through the eyes of a robot pschoanalyst i thought these stories were amazing and saw a definite flow to all the unlinked stories this made me very intriqued about how the movie was going to be i had read that alex proyas was going to take liberties with the plot but keep isaac asimovs vision intact i believe he failed miserably what mr proyas made was just another unbelievable action movie that appeal to the dense overly stimulated action freak with none of the intended vision to what he speaks of it is sad really there was so much emotion and cerebral moments that were lots in the mindless cgi and laws of physics bending fight sequences that have been over used by ever movie since the first matrix in fact they should have called this a matrix prequal that george lucas would have been proud of including the apparently useless sidekick kid from even stevens that did not have to do with anything in the story except a cheap laugh can you say jarjar there was some redeeming value there was some witty dialogue that kept the plot interesting but of course like all will smith movies there was far too many pointless oneliners another point was the fact that the leading lady was not just some no brain supermodel which was hard to believe that she actually could read the script denise richards in the world is not enough but they found some one less than perfect who was actually believable though still too young to be a brilliant scientist overall the movie was entertaining but not something that asimov would have been proud to go see

1,things that i liked about today so far maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude cicero one of the senators of rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues but the parent of all the others i liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout i like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when i reenter the building i like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter how splendorous they are in them i see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them i liked logging on to runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there the fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing i liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say hiiii how are youuuu and compliment each other instead of normally being irritated by that i actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each others presence and it made me happy to see that i like the complexity of the mathematics that i am doing and the fact that i am doing it i like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college i like having a picture of a god who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some versus a picture of an angry colonel with zero mercy i like the fact that i have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind i like the caprese sandwich i am eating with melted mozzarella tomato red peppers pesto sauce

0,well here i am i decided to start a blog now i am not entirely sure why i decided this for a number of reasons i am rubbish at writing journalsdiariesmost things so this is not going to be very good i really know anyone on this thing so no one is actually going to read it but i guess it might be therapeutic or something i live a relatively boring life so there is not going to be that much to write in here so apart from all them this seemed like a good idea at the time a few days ago i came back from a holiday in america america is awesome if you ever get a chance to go you should and if already been then go again i had a simply marvellous time visited both new york and orlando had to go to disneyland new york is like no where else i stupidly thought london was a big busy overcrowded city but it is nothing next new york city i am not sure if i would want to return as i have now done the whole statue of liberty show on broadway baseball game thing but saying that i do think i would like to go back with a bunch of mates and just go crazy florida was well hot and heat does not like me much therefore i tried to avoid it by standing under lots of fans despite this i still managed to get heat rash and a severe case of sun burn i think the sun does this to me on purpose i also discovered that universal studios is better than disney land i tell you if the rides at disney land are better than those at universal studios mainly due to the fact that i get on half of the rides at disney due to the immense amount of queuing it would have taken queuing that i can not be arsed to do hmm this is the end of my first entry i do not want to end it here as i do not think i have really told people much but my brain works in mysterious ways possibly through the use of small monkeys and lots of sticky tape but however it works it does not want to think of any more to write right now
1,i have just now realized now after years of experiencing it that what i have suffered from is depression soon after that i spoke to my dad about it and learned he had been on ads for over years now and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about years old on he also said my paternal grandmothers side of the family was all just like us my dad and i are almost carbon copies of each other except he is always seemed much more perfect to me than i am he also said my oldest half brother is also on ads i also talked to my oldest daughter who is yearold and she said she is been on ads a few times too i can say also that i learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before i was born he had shock therapy multiple times it seems but i do not know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in wwii or a combination of that plus other problems when i knew him he was always a sweet loving rather quiet man and my favorite person in the world other than my dad my dad said he never associated my problems with depression of course neither did i but now it all clicks i wish i had known all this when i was younger that depression had not had the stigma it had back in the and that i could have gotten treatment back then of course if i had i would not have the same life i have now so i guess i cannot complain about that and honestly would not change a thing i would not risk losing my kids or what i have accomplished no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been but i will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression especially my yearold daughter since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and i if i see it they will get the treatment they need immediately so in that sense i think this is a blessing knowledge is power
1,for those on antidepressants is it working alternatives to antidepressants okay so going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts suicidal ideation lack of motivation and interest high anxiety numbness hopelessness etc etc recently been coming back been on zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which i feel was working also tried xanax made me calmer but high and a mood stabilizer that really help since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back generally i like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but not going away my question to people is what antidepressants have worked how long have you been using them and has ur depression improved should i take it for the long term and what alternative methods have worked for you guys

1,going to bed in the morning waking up at night for about a year now i have been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the eveningnight it started because i transferred to online school and i thought it would be fine to stay up until am or so but it is gradually gotten worse and worse and as i am typing this it is am and i am just now getting ready to sleep i am guessing i will wake up at about pm and actually get out of bed at it is really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse people keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed or even staying up the whole day so i am very tired by nighttime but i just cannot find the willpower to go to sleep or get up i am not motivated to do anything anymore that i do not have to do i am starting to feel like a complete failure has anyone else experienced this or is experiencing it also i am taking a lot of melatonin but it still does not motivate me to actually get into bed

1,something i wrote during one of crying fits bridges were burned yet my heart it still yearns lessons were learned inside i still burn not a flame of love nor an ember of passion a blue flame lit reminiscent of what i am lacking a lonely lit candle that pains my insides those tears of mine dried up no longer can i cry new year i am out of luck anxious and somber here i lie i scratch and i scratch yet numbness blocks out the feeling there is no way to patch up i am broken glass i am far from healing empty conversations with people i could not care less about i envy healthy relationships ones that i could not have no doubt eyeballs that cannot weep and screams without sounds i am still depressed when people are around yet i am hard to read i am one to bleed waste time as i scroll through my social feeds waste hours as thoughts take over and i cannot sleep i cannot compete yet i cannot accept looping like a gif in my head the words you said up until now and from the day that we met if you read this thanks for reading
1,what depression is like for me having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer depression is forcing yourself out of bed not for yourself but those who count on you depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing depression is where people tell you it will all get better but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind depression is where you slowly lose your personality joy and interest for those things that you have used to love depression is where a stranger tells you i will be here for you and you take it as an insult depression is where you hurt crawl on the floor crying grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened to pretend nothing happened
0,am i being a bad friend or is she hey i am kind of new to reddit but i kind of need an opinion on a situation and i really hope the person i am talking about never reads this i have this close friend let us call her p and lately p and i have been having some problems p is annoyed because she thinks i do not spend enough time with her she is in one of my classes so i see her every other day for hours but that is not enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her she gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatorypassive aggressive texts during lunch about my location now keep in mind i am an honors student and i usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and i barely see my other friends who i am much closer to and do not share many classes with because of this i would be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends who she is also friends with and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when i try to talk to my best friends also i do not really like her personality sometimes she is kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons i e this one guy who is really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he was not interested and she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked to the point where i have stopped talked to him so she does not tell me about her dreams in which i make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous however she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on i understand her situation and that she feels like she is losing her only friend but i really do not like being controlled and walked on i also feel bad about her situation and i do not want her to cry make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friendstwist the situation which she has done before and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that i am overreacting and a bad friend so i am posting on here for a second unbiased opinion help
0,my mother died left me more the siblings my mother died recently she had a retirement account and life insurance i have two siblings the benefits are being paid and she left me much more then them i received about of her money i feel guilty and i am afraid my siblings will forever have animosity towards me and my mother both siblings left long ago one out of state and one out of the country i was the only one around for my mom for more then she got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal i was the only one here to help her last year and a half was very tough and i was her full time caregiver i gave up a everything as a business owner i lost most my clients compiled a mountain of debt and now i am alone to care for her house i gave up my place and pay the mortgage one sibling says it is unfair that i got more then twice him the conversation killed me because i think he is hurt by it and i feel guilty my mom told them before she died that i got the lions share but he says he did not think it was this much of a disparity i do not know what to do or how i should feel she always told me she had her reasons part of me thinks that fair is not always equal and i want to tell him that at the same time i do not want to feel entitled or like i deserve something more i do not know what to do if anything i do not feel like i should give them some of my inheritance i guess i am looking for a little validation and a little advise side note i do not think insurance companies and retirement funds should reveal the total policy or amounts and beneficiaries payout percentage this is what causes problems
1,is not it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun when you are really dealing with those feelings for real there are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms this usually never gets to me because many people do not actually get what it means to be depressed even depressed people experience things in a spectrum however when i feel like i am falling off the wagon and i see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughtscoping mechanisms of genuinely depressed peoplemelancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell i just go completely bonkers and i do not really know why anyone else feel like this sorry for terrible punctuation

1,hi sorry if this turns into a lengthy post but i could do with some advice and i think this is probably the best place to ask firstly i should point out i am a year male my problem is that i am concerned by the physical effects the depression is having on me i have probably been suffering from depression for several years but i only sought medical help last november after i had a breakdown the doctor has prescribed me with fluoxetine and i am taking per day i originally started off on per day but after i told the doctor what i will tell you now about months ago he upgraded my status to severe depression hence the increase in dosage i can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative and expecting the worst but nevertheless i cannot help but feel my symptoms might be the result of an even more serious problem the medication has helped my mind even though i still have plenty of lows they am not always as severe as they were months ago yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that is the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks my symptoms are as follows and they may be generalized i will admit constant fatigue even after plenty of rest constant aching throughout the body generally feeling very weak lacking energy and strength e g carrying shopping home can leave my arms in agony loss of coordination i have become very clumsy always knocking glasses over or dropping things for no reason occasional loss of balance usually when getting up or starting to walk from a stand still joints are feeling slightly stiff they still move but i can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if was to use them or even just hold my arms straight out in front of me and for me the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hands and arms which sometimes spreads throughout the body if i attempt slow fine movements with my hands the tremor becomes very clear and results in jerky movements also i like to exercise yet after all exercises even low intensity ones the trembling seems to intensify i doubt it is anxiety as i still shake when i am calm relaxed and immobile i know i cannot expect i diagnosis but i would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effects i am experiencing is quite common even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover thanks for any help

1,the last days felt like the first days of my life today feels like the beginning of the last days i have been having depression since senior year i have been fighting non stop for years i took gap years to fight depression until last october i thought depression has gone because i felt totally normal at that time during the time i had a lot of ups and downs lots of tears lots of laugh but i have never given up on myself last november my brother did sth bad and my ex attempted suicide that is when i got depressed again the first time in years until days ago i met a girl perfect stranger is the word that would suit her the most my situation with her is exactly like in the movie before we go by chris evan strangers meet each other out of billion people but they would never see each other again and days after we met we hung out everyday for the last days she is gone we still keep contact but i do not think i would ever see her again please do not ask why she knows about depression she made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed the last days were the happiest days of my life it feels like i actually live for the first time but i also got depressed since i got depressed because i could not recall her image i could not recall her face i could not recall what she looked like when we first met and i could not remember why those were the happiest days of my life i just recall those were the happiest all i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like secs her voice and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart everything is so blurry then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression and it leads me to depression and memory loss and depression and alzheimer then i started to she had tears i was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories what if it actually comes what if one day i would not remember her my mom my best friends and even myself i was teaching in class when i she had tears i had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for mins luckily noone noticed i remembered my promise to her i was about to text her and then i started to cry again i will bother her i will make her worried i will waste her time and i cannot afford to hurt people i love this is the beginning of the end please help
0,i did not want have to post this but i have to get it off my chest i do not expect to get sympathy from this but closure i have a cousin who i have known for years and over time he became more and more distant he got friends most of them were verbally abusing me you would think he would defend me but he backed up his friends than his own blood me growing up i was and still to this day an introvert and i never kept a close friend because they would either stop talking to me or they would say that they do not like me and for the years that i have known his friends they eventually got used to me and we played online frequently and months ago they disapproved of me getting a gta shark card in game currency then they insult me saying i need to grow up and mature basically telling me how to run my life and i tried to stand up for myself but they still kept saying it its my life if i want to act silly then i will but the main focus is my cousin and how he was brutally honest you know how we hype up our friend to make them feel good about himselfherself that is not what he did every time we play online with one of his friends he would agree and add insult to injury when his friend makes fun of me in games he would tell everyone to go after me in cod he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he is the leader but the sole reason i am making this post was the fact that he did one of if not the rudest thing ever heres how it went it was my sisters birthday i was texting and he said that he is coming to the party and i am pretty happy a smile stretches around my face i say ok cool an hour passes by and he nonchalantly says welp sorry i cannot come oh well and i ask why and he says i do not know now usually most would tell the reason why cannot come or if they do not they make up something but he all of a sudden says i cannot come i want you keep in mind that the last time i was in his house was years ago and he has only came over for my birthdays or sometime in the fall so he rarely comes to my house and i am not even allowed back at his house because of personal reasons but anyway he could not come to my house but has time to go to his friends house whenever he wants gee i wonder why he did what no other friend should have done and hurt my feelings all in one fell swoop i am done with him but if he asks for forgiveness should i ignore him accept his apology i am not expecting an answer but whatever
1,i have to get this out goodnight on my instagram i post a message every night telling people not to hurt themselves and other things that might make them feel better every night and i have gotten at least a messages back telling me how much i have helped but i cannot even take my own advice i do not listen to myself i have depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts constantly but it is been getting to hard to fight i am exhausted when i wake up there is so much more i cannot explain depression for me like something invisible is suffocating me constantly literally every waking minute i suffer the only thing holding me back is guilt but i will not feel it when i am dead reddit this might be my goodbye i will let you know if i wake up if anyone ever reads this you are stronger than me

1,my name is jessica i am years old and my boyfriend and i have just broken up after years i am not sure where to begin our bickering and fighting started about a year ago and even though it was always small stupid things we were fighting about i guess it all built up in the end i know it is probably for the best but i love him and hate the thought of losing him he means the world to me i just feel like things will take so long to get back to normal with me especially because we are living together i am in college hence living in student apartments i do not want him to move out because i do not want to be totally alone here i am going to miss him and his stupid and crazy ways but most of all his company when we were not fighting or when he was over reacting about things i just do not know what to do at the moment i am sure in a few months i will move on but i will never get over it he said he still loves me and that maybe in a few months or years we might get back together because he does not want to spend the rest of his life with anyone else but me but i just cannot deal at the moment i am beginning to think from reading other messages that i may be really slightly depressed or anxious or something a lot has happened in my life and he knows it all i just did not know who i can really talk to about such personal issues anymore
0,my younger brother is cooler than me hi so i have a bit of an embarassing truth to admit i believe my younger brother is way cooler than me i have never been one of the most popular people in any given situation but i have a few close friends so it is not too bad my brother however is one of those people that can walk into a room and immediately own it where my clothing style is a bit uninteresting his is eyecatching while i am fairly quiet and not particularily funny he is confident and charismatic i get invited to parties every now and then but he gets invited to parties every week oh and it does not help that he is taller than me nowadays he is not better than me at everything thankfully for instance i am an organised person and my grades are far above average while his grades are far below the point is that i am not a cool person by any stretch but he is very popular and respected it is silly i know but it does hurt my pride a bit seeing as i am older than him and you usually expect the older sibling to have the high ground in this respect am i alone in this anyone else who have experienced something similar p
0,overbearing family i am living away from home for college in my year however i still feel very under the control of my mother it is just me and her at home and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently had enough of how much she expects from me i am studying for grade piano and the fact is that i simply have time for it she wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for months bare in mind i only get to practice once a week as i have no piano away from home i come home at weekends when i postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things i told her i was too busy with college work i got my results back for college and did very well however she still happy first comment was not as stupid as we and then said that i could do a lot better even though i did really well i never leave the house when at home for weekends or any holidays because when i go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before i leave and guilt trips me about going i have been wanting a full time bar job for summer as where my experience is but she is even controlling where i work and telling me where to apply to she keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college and saying on a permanent holiday she is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend she never uses his name only refers to him as in a sneering voice and she meet him she is by no means a bad person she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and i feel very restricted and at times controlled but i am not giving out about her simply want to understand why she is acting this way when given her no reason to distrust me and trying my best tldr mother is controlling putting huge pressure on me and is never happy no matter how well i do

1,i hate it when bad people get rewarded one of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably and loved by all it is hard for me to stomach for example i saw one of my former bullies enter the store i work at she was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school such as defacing my sketchbook purposefully kicking my food away sending me fake love letters and more anyway the bully now had two children i am having trouble conceiving so that stings and i think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also catching up by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business when i got home that night i looked her up on facebook and she does have a much better life than mine in every way i feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while i have struggled

0,family problems hello i want to talk about things in my household now and maybe get some opinions on it okay so my sister is she is the oldest i am the middle child and my brother who is is the youngest our dad works abroad and comes back a few times a year but we talk on phone almost everyday my sister studies in a university and comes back usually on weekends and then maybe some other days depending on her schedule when she comes back everyone in the house starts fighting and she is the problem when she is home everything we do is wrong we were raised wrong mom spoils us mom does not love her we do not want her here and when my mom says that she causes the problems she bursts into tears goes to her room cries for a bit and leaves to her boyfriends house because she feels loved there and that is how it always goes she comes back says that my brother does not do anything in this is house and that he is a spoiled brat fights over something bursts into tears and leaves she is very emotional when she accuses my brother of something and he calls her some kind of name she immediately stars crying like it is the end of the world last night she texted my mom saying that she raised us poorly and that mom does not love her she said that she is going to be leaving our home and will not come back because we do not want her there of course me as the peace maker in the family wrote her a huge message about how she is wrong how we actually love her is just that she does not see it and everything else she wrote back about how i am wrong about how my brother is spoiled and again everything else i will agree my brother is the youngest and he can be a brat but that is the point he is the youngest and i do not see how you can make a problem out of everything like dude chill oml you are not dying guys how the hell do we make her understand or maybe she should leave get some time alone maybe understand herself better but she is an almost adult she should be the smart one she one that understands

1,hey there depression me ya boi a letter for you by urs truly dear depression look my dude i showered in a week and although i bleached my hair so you see how dirty it is when that happens i can still feel it and would really like to use that coconut shampoo i bought that makes me smell like well coconuts not sure what i smell like right now but probably not fruit maybe that lavender febreze i spray all the time if lucky i done laundry in a month or so i wore the same two dirty pairs of pants to work all week the long ones because even though been around all week i worked up the energy to shave my legs in forever like sure and girls can be as hairy as they want these days woo go feminism or we but jeannie from accounting noticed when i had two vaguely different socks bc i was too lazy to find a matching pair and i need to give her any more reasons to open her big mouth tbh i only got out of bed today to pee and eat a sandwich which i thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich not the pee but maybe the pee a little bit too not in a weird way tho so nice to know i can still enjoy things even if developed an unhealthy coping method with food and am going to get fatter and hate my body even more but hey at least not drugs which also reminds me that i need to do dishes or i could just keep buying disposable dishes so that i can let that pile up in the trash i desperately need to take out instead i have shit got to do that i was supposed to do last weekend but also spent that weekend in bed terrible in bed btw and considering that writing this at instead of sleeping like i was supposed to start doing several hours ago after i was supposed to take the meds that i get up to take the forecast for today is pretty bleak as well of course you know all this because you like to stop by every couple weeks and make sure of it i think more regular than my time of the month which would probably be more regular if i could just stick to taking my birth control every day but we already established that i suck at taking pills that supposed to i wish i could just get up and do what i need to do like a real adult so many people do it and on my best days i can even pretend to be a real adult as well but with you here lurking around my apartment without even helping with the vaguely overpriced rent i seem to get anything done so if you could just like leave for a couple of days before i run out of clean underwear too i would greatly appreciate it sincerely a concerned citizen

1,i need to get this out feel free to ignore it potential triggers domestic and parental abuse self harm bullying substance abuse etc avoiding detail amap i am so sick of trying to just survive each day i want more than anything to go out and live my life i want a job an apartment a pet but instead stuck living with my grandparents because at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad i can barely leave my bed i think i have felt for more than minutes at any given time in the last months i applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars i have from when i got really bad but they never contacted me again so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head trying to be a partner to this amazing guy i care a ton about but i feel so emotionally shut down that i even react to jokes or love anymore i even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger now i do not have it as bad as a lot of other people i grew up in a family with a loving ocd grandmother a grandfather and a drug addict mother who all always made sure i had food and a place to sleep that alone is more than a lot of people get but every time i try to talk to someone and they respond to me i flip out at them because my mom want me to interrupt her high when something goes slightly wrong or is a smidge out of place i panic because all i had around me when someone on the street spits i flinch because my favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me when i go downtown i get anxious because where i was publicly beating by a different yet no les ex i avoid drinking now because i want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and i definitely want to add to my scars but this is all i have known my whole life every time i try to take a step forward improve myself or even leave the house to do something i once enjoyed it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt the only ways i know how to make money things i want to do the only people in my life i want to be around i stand to be near i feel like i have nothing left to hold onto and drowning check into the hospital just to get away but unless i were to actually make an attempt on my life they accept me but at least we have free healthcare right i just need a day of normal

1,i think you guys might understand this i was walking with a close friend after having lunch together and i told her i feel as if i am living on borrowed time she asked me to explain further but i could not find the words to better express that perspective she then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she is nearly died on some of the trips she is taken i confessed that i could not really relate to those sorts of situations or how they have affected her as she has more zeal for life than anyone i have ever met whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death did not suit me then the words came to me i feel as if i am living on borrowed time because i feel like i could at any moment lose what little will to live i have left it is like i am waiting for the other shoe to drop i see it in slowmotion slowly falling to the cold pavement but i do not know when it will finally make contact in the meantime i am existing trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as i am able to but i cannot shake the conviction that i will eventually resolve to leave by my own hand despite whatever life i have made for myself the fights already been lost and at some point i will have to accept defeat
